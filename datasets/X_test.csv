Why wasn't Ariadne Oliver in Poirot's last case? It seems odd to me that she wasnt in his final case she seemed like such an essential and complementary character towards the end of the series. Why do you think Agatha chose to leave her out?

"Tips for embodying Sherlock Holmes over Zoom? I‚Äôm an amateur actor and I‚Äôve very unexpectedly been cast as Sherlock Holmes in a virtual dramatization of The Hound of the Baskervilles. I‚Äôm a bit of an enthusiast and have read about 20 stories and 3 of the novels and seen many adaptations, but I‚Äôm still very intimidated by this role.

Here‚Äôs where things get weird: I‚Äôm a woman in my 20‚Äôs. I do not have an aquiline profile; I have chubby cheeks and a snub nose. I‚Äôm also 5‚Äô4,‚Äù but at least it‚Äôs not a live stage production. 

How can I embody the spirit of Holmes well enough to keep audience members from switching off the video 2 minutes in when they see a woman who looks like a cabbage patch kid is playing the great detective? 

I should add that I‚Äôm pretty experienced at playing male characters, including major Ibsen and Shakespeare roles (even Hamlet), but none have as characteristic a physical appearance as Holmes."
"Help me find this episode My girlfriend is trying to find out an episode she wants us to rewatch but can‚Äôt remember much about it. It‚Äôs a vague description, but I‚Äôll post the message she sent me. Maybe someone can help:

‚ÄúIn the Poirot episode the girl characters help each other in the kitchen cook and stir together the dish. 
And the housekeeper makes a dish they will have on two occasions in separate bowls. 
One for each night. 
For the first dinner party... they were tocserve the first batch but the lady had dropped it and it ruined so they used the second batch to serve in place of the first. 
The first one had the poison in it so no one ended up eating it and the heinous plan was ruined then too‚Äù"

"Best first Poirot for young teen? I‚Äôd like to introduce my 12 year old daughter to Poirot, either by book or film/tv.  In your opinion, which story best introduces the key principles of the Poirot tradition?

I‚Äôm hoping for something that‚Äôs pretty simple, pretty clever, and not too gory.  

(So many great Poirots (Orient Express, Curtain) are brilliant variations on the basic principles that just don‚Äôt make sense unless you understand what those principles are and how this book brilliantly subverts them.)"
Stephen Fry talks Sherlock and Jeremy Brett
Poirot and Morality (possible spoiler) [Spoiler] In later episodes of the TV series with Suchet poirot is all about morality and the like. Although in several episodes he lets criminals go free (Orient Express comes to mind). Other episodes he knows that if the criminal is alone they will probably kill themselves (Dead Mans Folly) and yet he did so anyway. He even says ‚ÄúBon‚Äù after the shots are heard in Dead Mans Folly. And obviously the old debate with ‚ÄúCurtain‚Äù. Personally I felt it was very dark compared to most episodes which it‚Äôs on purpose.
I don‚Äôt like the Sherlock Holmes movie. He starts doing Kung Fu which just seems completely out of character. Also the plot is mind-numbing complicated.
Poirot on Amazon. I‚Äôve always watched Poirot on Amazon. I have a few early seasons on DVD but only like 1-3. I‚Äôve noticed a few weeks ago that seasons 9-12 aren‚Äôt available anymore even though they used to be. Does anyone have any insight to this? Maybe a licensing issue? It‚Äôs driving me nutty having to switch from the 8th season all the way to the 13th.

"Just finished ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"", wanted to post my thoughts and vent a bit (Huge Spoilers) So, I loved it, but it was ruined for me by how many articles list it as the best Poirot story. Whether it is or not, I haven't read enough to know (I've only previously finished Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile). 

See, the problem is the way it's talked about. Articles kept mentioning how it's got such a shocking twist, and that nobody could possibly guess the murderer... so of course I thought to myself, well when a whodunnit is all about figuring out who the unexpected murderer is, then who is the most unexpected? And immediately it stuck out that unlike Death on the Nile, which I had just finished a day before starting The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, this one was first person.

So I had those alarm bells, and am also very much a believer of the mentality ""A good writer doesn't point out things that aren't important"". Sure, red herrings and all that, but bringing up the dictaphone, then Sheppard's hobby of tinkering with gadgets, both had me thinking about them most the novel. Then the second they reveal Ralph I was like ""Unreliable narrator, it was Sheppard, done."" (I even remember much earlier being like, why does nobody suspect the doctor after the reveal that the niece never saw Roger? Even if we're supposed to trust him, the police have no reason not to suspect he could have sneaked back in somehow, but I chalked it up to maybe it being a societal thing, doctors being held in higher regard than others kind of thing). 

What bugs me though, is that I wouldn't have figured it out if top lists didn't have this ""You'll never guess"" mentality about it. Kind of reverse psychology'd myself into it, which has left me kind of unsatisfied with figuring it out. Feel like I figured it out using supplemental clues.

Edit: Also just watched the episode afterwards, and though I enjoy the show and Suchet's performance, really feel like they butchered what makes the book so clever by not telling it from the perspective of Sheppard proper, having Poirot be less buddy-buddy with him, and tacking on an ending that makes him feel much more like a more conventional cartoonish villain. That they replace him in so many scenes with Japp also made him feel much more plausible a suspect throughout that everyone seems to trust for no reason. And lastly, though I understand that often they have to combine characters and omit things for brevity, but combining two characters with such vastly different personalities as Raymond and Blunt, and giving that character some of Parker's roles in the story, while making Parker also less shifty, it just felt like a lot of the best parts of the plot were omitted/cut."
A Sherlockian Christmas: Items from Our Arthur Conan Doyle Collection at Toronto Public Library
"My thoughts on 'The Man With The Twisted Lip' *The Man With The Twisted Lip* is an unusual Holmes story. Rather than investigating a murder or robbery, this time there may not even have been a crime committed.

The story begins when a Mrs St Clair engages Sherlock Holmes to find her husband, a wealthy city worker who‚Äôs gone missing. She last saw him at the window of an opium den, where he seemed to be dragged backwards. After rushing up to find him, she burst into the room to find no-one but a disfigured beggar. On finding her husband‚Äôs clothes in the room, the police arrested the beggar but have since found no clues to Mr St Clair‚Äôs whereabouts. 

A few days later, Mrs St Clair receives a letter from her husband assuring her that he is fine and well ‚Äì forcing Holmes to rethink the direction of his investigation. 

*The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* collects some of the most memorable, colourful and surprising of the Holmes stories. Whether this is due to Conan Doyle‚Äôs fresher writing in the early days or simply because when I re-read my collection these come first, it‚Äôs too early to say. This is one, of a good number, that I can recall the entire mystery from the title alone.

As with all the Holmes stories, *The Man With The Twisted Lip* has been adapted many times over the years for tv and radio. Most directly, it was part of the 1980s Granada Jeremy Brett series, but also featured in *Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd* *Century* and the opening scene was used as part of the *Sherlock* episode *His Last Vow*.

Spoilers if you dig deeper into this next bit of trivia, but the story may have been inspired by the work of [Arthur Pember](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Pember#Journalist). Pember wrote a series of articles for the *New York Times* in the 1870s, disguising himself as a range of identities, including as a beggar and circus performer, to research his articles. 

&amp;#x200B;

One other small point of note, it‚Äôs in *The Man With The Twisted Lip* that Mary Watson refers to her husband as ‚ÄúJames‚Äù rather than John. Some have theorised she‚Äôs using the English version of hi middle name ‚ÄúHamish‚Äù but this was never confirmed by Conan Doyle.

Every time I read this story I enjoy it, despite knowing exactly what‚Äôs about to happen. [Conan Doyle ranked the story as his 16th favourite from the series](https://strandmag.com/top-ten-sherlock-holmes-stories/), one of many he chose from his first collection *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*, and it‚Äôs hard to disagree."
"A quote from on of the books Sherlock says when questioned by Watson about his cocaine addiction that I cannot find anymore for some reason. Help please? I'm trying to find a quote, something Sherlock says to Watson, when questioned about why he does cocaine. I believe it was from Study in Scarlet but I could be wrong.

I'm paraphrasing, but from the best of my memory, it was something along the lines of;

""My keen spirit is chaffed by involuntary inaction.""

Thanks in advance if you could correct me and remind me which book it was. "

"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 10 I observed an entertaining and enlightening incident in the mess one evening soon after our new residents arrived. Young Stewart, Gill's replacement, was in conversation with cadet Cottle. Cottle was explaining the intricacies of the dartboard which hangs on the mess wall.

""This is a London board. It has a doubles ring, a triples ring, and a double bullseye within a single bullseye. There also exist elsewhere a Manchester board with no triples ring, and a Lincoln board with no triples and no double bullseye. The random numbers around the outside define the wedges dividing the circle into twenty pie-shaped segments. The single bullseye scores 25.

""Many regional games may be played on a dartboard. The most standard game played all across England is called '301'. To begin, a player needs to throw a dart into the outside doubles ring. The score of that dart and all subsequent scores subtract from 301. The player throws 3 darts on each of his turns. The winning dart must reduce his score to exactly zero by hitting a double. So, if a player has 4 remaining, he will win by hitting the double 2. If he hits a single 2 in that effort, he will win by hitting a double 1. Should he 'bust', go over his number, his turn ends and on his next turn he will begin from where he began on the last.

""You seem very knowledgeable, Mr. Cottle.""

""Not wishing to brag, but I have taken my share of wagers. The skill has kept my glass full in many taverns.""

Hauser, our cook, was sitting within earshot and spoke up. ""You should challenge Miss Adler. She, too, is quite adept. None of us are up to matching her. We call her 'The Crusher'. It would be a pleasure to see her compete against someone on her level.""

Cottle could not keep the amusement out of his voice. ""A woman dart player, a capable woman dart player? That would be more than remarkable.""

Just then the subject of conversation walked through the door. Hauser called her over and suggested Cottle would like to witness her proficiency on the board.

Water glasses on a side-wall shelf held individual sets of darts. Cottle judged that those who played had made their own from needles or nails, wood dowels, and various forms of vanes at the rear. Some were works of art and some were primitive. Miss Adler plucked out a set that seemed serviceable but unremarkable.

""I encourage our team to learn how to throw darts, not so much as a game or even a weaponry defense, but as a mental discipline. It is a Zen-like exercise - can you instruct your body to act with the precision of a machine?""

She walked to the throw line, took aim, and put her three darts in a relatively tight center group. Cottle was obviously taken aback. He was game, though. He asked to examine her darts. He hefted them a few times and asked if she'd mind if he threw them. She obliged. He proceeded to put up a close group himself. They went back and forth a half dozen times. Her's were always a bit better, but not by much.

By this time Sherlock and I had come in and joined the watchers. Miss Adler suggested a change. She went to the line, threw her first dart. It was as good as any she'd launched so far. She took a step forward and put the second next to the first. Then she took two steps back and her third dart rubbed shoulders with the others.

Thinking that was no great accomplishment Cottle pulled the darts from the board and took position at the line. His first dart may have been better than her's had been. At a step forward his second flew high, almost at the triple ring. Addled, he took two steps back, threw his dart. It barely missed the bottom of the board.
The Crusher had struck again. Sherlock turned away to hide a smile.

It took a moment or two but Cottle was not ready to give in. ""That is most impressive and I bow to your skill. I do have another request, though."" He proceeded to explain the rules of the 301 game and suggested they play - with a wager. The stakes being her choice.
She considered the proposition. He was clearly goading her.

""Everyone here but myself and the Messrs. Holmes (by that time every resident was in the room) takes a turn each morning stoking up the kitchen fires for the day. I will take that duty for anyone who bests me at the 301 game and I will double my opponent's score each turn. If you throw 40 points, it will count as 80."" This was delivered with great braggadocio. ""If I win there will be no penalty for the loser, and I insist on extending the advantage to everyone.""

The last was a blatant taunt to Cottle.

En masse they thought it great fun.

As main contender and instigator, the first match would be Cottle's. He won the option to throw first. His initial dart was a double 20, followed by a single 20, the third was a triple 20. 
The watchers applauded. His thrown score was 120 points and doubling made it 240 which, when subtracted from 301, left 61.

He retrieved the darts from the board and handed them to Miss Adler. She accepted them with her left hand and extended her right to shake hands. ""Nice game. Thank you.""

He looked bewildered.

She said, without malice of any sort, ""There is nothing you can throw which, when doubled, will leave you with a number divisible by 2. You can't win.""

It took the onlookers full minutes to accept her words. As each did he began to laugh until the entire room was laughing - including Cottle.

Miss Adler joined Sherlock and myself. She was the first to voice the concern going through each of our minds. ""If we are to interpret the financial dealings of the countries under our scrutiny the next addition to the colony must be someone who understands numbers.

"Mary played Moriarty's video to save Sherlock..!! After S4 E1 , it is quite obvious that Mary was the one who had Moriarty's ""MISS ME..??"" Video play out everywhere..It was probably to show her gratitude and also because she knew that owing to her past, only Sherlock Holmes would be able to protect John n herself in case of an unforeseen attack. Her CD which was titled ""MISS ME..??"" in which Mary says 'I knew this would get your attention' probably also points at Mary being behind the entire Video drama."

"The Copper Beeches - Mrs. Violet Hunter When people talk about women in the Sherlock Holmes cases there always seems to be fixation on Irene Adler and while her somewhat outsmarting Sherlock is notable I have to say that Mrs. Violet Hunter left a more lasting impression on me. 

She's educated (speaking English, some German and some French, music and drawing), has great intuition, she ends up as a teacher, she's not involved with any men romantically, she's an orphan, she's a great observer and Sherlock compares her to the actions he would advise for if he had a sister. 
For me she paints a really progressive picture of what women could be and have been at the time. 

She isn't looked on as a woman that has shady motives, is greedy or completely devoted to a man, she's not in a role of motherhood and she isn't having an affair.  

She shows one model of so women that contrast to many other in the book. Her marriage free, child free, educationally interested and educated, unbound and clever character is really unique."

Obsessed So it's really good to know that I'm not the only Poirot super geek out there.  My mother watched it when I was a kid on PBS but I took no interest.  I was laid off from work about 5-6 years ago when it was on Netflix.  6 years later I watch at least one episode every week.  Over the course of 13 seasons I still find it hard to get sick of and I can probably recite most episodes word for word.
"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 4 Our casual repast was relatively quick and quiet, everyone being past the point of exhaustion. Certainly no-one exhibited curiosity at the sudden introduction of a strange woman. The permanent colony staff knew not to discuss any matter with anyone who was not directly involved. 


Miss Adler was introduced to Pencer and informed that he could relay whatever messages she wished sent to London. She would not be suspicious that our isolated location was not on the phone - but of course we were - by multiple direct lines.


.


Consideration of distaff accommodations had never been part of the original planing. If truth be told, I would have thought the question negligible, and Sherlock would have thought it insurmountable. In the event, I would have been more correct than he. Miss Adler was shown to one of our guest cabins and left to her own devices.


.


Back at the cottage Sherlock and I discussed the startling turn of affairs. Adler was undeniably an overly bright individual and could not be immune from (a) wondering what we were about, and (b) coming to the correct answer, at least to the extent of compromising our cloak of non-existence. On the other hand it was not so much what we did, it was that we were very good at it. The big issue was she knew where we did it. Short of stuffing her into a poke and tossing her back into the sea our options were few.


Our quandary became more intense when Pencer provided us with the content of two messages which Adler requested be sent.


The first was a detailed list of large money transfers between individuals in various German cities and eight seemingly unrelated names. It was to go to a Mr. Hodges at the American embassy, the confidentiality to be verified and assured by Pencer. The second message was short and in code, same recipient.


Sherlock and I agreed the first message would be sent through a London intermediary. I knew Hodges as an upper level official. We would decide on the second when we had better insight. 


The lad, Gill, was the nearest to Miss Adler's size. He was instructed to provide for her trousers, a tunic, and a pair of light slippers, and to advise her if she left her clothes and shoes outside her door they would be cleaned and returned. They would, of course, be examined by Sherlock and myself first. Her shoes might be keep slightly longer. She was also invited to dine with the Holmes brothers at the cottage that evening.


Not long after those arrangements were completed a response from the lady's first message came back. It warned that those who had orchestrated her pursuit across Europe were not deterred by the past night's failure. They remained resolute that she be captured or killed. She was instructed to go to ground - if safe, not to move.


That answer had not as yet been delivered to the lady and would not be for at least another day since she was not to know we had phone and wireless telegraphy. Should anyone ever question the authenticity of magic I can only cite what women are capable of with their toilet. Miss Adler had been furnished with soap, a flannel, a pitcher of warm water, and a wash bowl - the same as to everyone one else in the colony. What incantation she might have employed, or potion she might have drawn from the air, I'm sure I'll never know. What I do know is that when she arrived at the cottage she was a total transformation from the coarse canvas of her earlier self into conservatory velvet.


Hauser's talents proved equal to the company.


""Miss Adler"", I began when we had settled into our meal, ""I hope you will forgive my directness, but what are your immediate plans? That is not to say your presence is unwelcome, but you have invaded a male preserve. We are not really prepared for guests.""


""Please allow me to be direct - perhaps even more direct"", she answered. ""I have come to realize this is a delicate preserve as well, and that my intrusion has created a much greater inconvenience than simply disturbing a reclusive gentleman's contemplations. You have my very sincerest regrets and I do understand those regrets cannot change the unchangeable.""


""Before we travel down that path,"" interrupted Sherlock, ""I wish to counter direct with blunt. Earlier today you wrote a message in code. Would you explain the nature of that message?""


""That communiqu√© is meant for my younger brother. He is, as you probably already know I am, a spy. For the safety of both of us we do not correspond directly or share the particulars of our individual activities."" Admitting this she looked directly at me.


""The message is only to assure him I am safe and well since he is no doubt aware of my current jeopardy. My career is finished with this latest mission. I am too well known, under too many names and disguises, in too many countries. I'm also a bit too old to be rowing across the Straits of Dover in the middle of the night and sleeping in trees. I can only hope my information proves worth the sacrifice.""


""Would you be so kind as to write for me the exact text uncoded?, asked Sherlock.


She obliged and I handed to Sherlock what had been supplied by Pencer. He compared the two side by side for a few minutes then nodded to me. After another pause he nodded again and I retrieved from the same pocket the response which had come in answer to her first message.


""How...? Her mouth opened and forgot to close. ""Oh my.""


""Miss Adler"", I said, ""would you consider an alternative line of employ for a different firm?"" Sherlock looked at the ceiling.

"Vintage Poirot i went on Amazon music and searched for Poirot. In addition to finding music from the series I also came across some vintage American radio Poirot mystery broadcasts. I have not seen a year but the broadcast mentions the wartime so I gather they are from the 1940's.

"Translation of Sherlock Holmes Hi, I'm a Brazilian student and I'm researching about  a short story of sir Arthur Conan Dolye called The Five Orange Pips. Because of that, I need some translations of this story, especially to Portuguese. I'd appreciate any help. Thanks!!"
"My thoughts on Enola Holmes Frist, I only just watched the movie and I will compare it to the original books from sir Author Conan Doyle at times. I know the movie is based off of a different book series, which I haven't read however.

Also, English isn't my first language. Also, this is all my opinion. You're allowed to disagree. 

Mycroft.
He is nothing like the one sir A.C.D. books and that hurts a bit. He was portrayed as one of the  stupid, money hungry, sexist, social, one to easily curse about a 16 year old and fit. All of these are not traits when I think of the original.
I do not dislike the idea of someone wanting to get Enola to be a fine lady and I very much found the scene on the carriage, where Enola had to hand over her money, very much heartbreaking and good for the plot... It just hurt that it came from Mycroft too

Sherlock.
First, in the movie he had blue eyes, when the original states that he has icy Grey ones. I think one wasn't very much able to see what kind of genius he has. Like when he looked at the flowers, it seemed a bit off. But when he explained where he had found the letters, it much more seemed like the Sherlock one expected. I know that the main focus should lay on Enola... But I just wished that they would have portrayed Mycroft as the smartest (perhaps more or less in secret or clouded by his lazy was), then Sherlock, then Enola with her rising up and gaining the other factors of being a good detective and becoming as good or better as Sherlock. I think they even showed that by Enola getting better with her disguises and fighting and in the scene where Sherlock came to Lestrade to report the crime, which she already did. I think they could have made that more obvious, that she didn't have all that it takes from the beginning.
But in the end, Sherlock was nice and I enjoyed him very much.

The mother.
Oi,  I think she is a bit of a mess, but that is also what she is supposed to resemble. In the books from sir A.C.D. Sherlock had described his past as rather normal. I think it was shortly before  Mycroft got introduced for the first time. It makes me wonder if the mother had given Mycroft and Sherlock similar lives while growing up. If yes, why are both so anti social/very introverted/very far away from family in the movies logic? Or was the affection only for Enola and then why?
In the End, I don't understand why she lead Enola on. Like with the cards and the ribbons and stuff. She wanted her to find the explosives on purpose, but why? Was she really mad? And if she was, then why wasn't Enola mad or worried about her in the end? She did abandon her. She was careless. I think she was pretending to be a good mother.
'Yes I will just head out now to possibly kill some people. I will not inform my 16 year old daughter, who is very much dependent on me. I want her to be fine when she is alone ((which is kind of disregarding her child's actual wants and needs)) that's why I make riddles for her and possibly leave her in the thought that im dead'.

Enola.
I think they tried her typical boyish. She was very much eager to be what her mother had taught her, but she still made mistakes along the way, which I very much liked. I don't like the weird relationship she had with the lord (who's name I can't remember, but I think it was Marcus). Like 'ye I hate you, you idiot, but I also kinda missed you'. All in all it was cheesy (and I love cheesy).
I feel like it's hard to get real character traits off of her and I'm not sure why. I think it's easier to get her over all feeling instead of her likes and Dislikes and so on. And her feeling is.. 'I'm smart and funny' and 'haha, fuck you all, I'm me bitch'.
Though I still very much enjoyed her. Seeing her transform and learn even still. Personally I didn't find the 4rth wall breaking annoying, but I rather took it as small treats to get a better inside. Though I would understand how people would find that and her character annoying.

The lord (Marcus I think).
I think he was more to portray typical girly character traits. He seemed nice and I enjoyed him very much also. Though I doubt that he was actually able to climb up that rope at his little tree house. I think that scene where Enola goes through the place was a bit confusing, but it also gave more depth to his character. He is 100% gay in my opinion XD. The romance between him and Enola is cute, but I couldn't really see it working out. Opposites attrack each other, but are you sure about that? XD
He is a cute boy. Fitted into the plot.


Things that especially bothered me:
Mycroft. Why did the mother lead Enola on to find her explosives? Why did Enola just decide that a random boy in danger deserves more attention than her mother endangering other lifes with bombs? Why are they trying to push the matter that Mycroft is more of a family guy than Sherlock? Is the mother really as good as Enola (and everyone else) thinks? 

Things that I especially liked:
That Enola was pushed down to her lowest, but she still got up. Her being send to that school was heartbreaking and it was even a bit unexpected or at least for me. Enola showing her line of reasoning with the viewer. The story with the small bits all coming together nicely.

. 

I think this can go onto my list of favorite movies especially when they will make a sequel or if I decide to read the books of which it was actually based off of.

"New episode of Amateur Detective Club! Agatha Christie‚Äôs Poirot, Death In The Clouds!"
We reviewed Dumb Witness for Amateur Detective Club! And I can say WE ALL LOVE BOB.
"Weird connexion between Appointment with Death and Murder on the Orient Express I'm reading Appointment with Death right now, and at some point one of the characters makes a clear reference to the events of Murder on the Orient Express, more precisely the ending.

I won't get into details to not be too spoiler-y, but basically both novels have the same ethical dilemma : Poirot investigates the murder a terrible human being. Terrible, but still human, so Poirot can't let that slide, even if everyone around him tells him that he should...  
In Murder on the Orient Express, he eventually decides to keep the true culprit's indentity a secret, just this time. And, of course, he promises to not tell anyone : it would both condemn the people he chose to save, but also ruin his own reputation.

BUT in Appointment with Death, one the suspects clearly tells Poirot that he can let go of this murder case, since he's done it before, during the Orient Express incident. Of course Poirot doesn't confirm that he did what he's accused of, but, still, how the hell does this person know about his biggest secret ?  
Basically, who spilled the bean ?!

It's clearly established in the Poirot stories that the books themselves do exist in this universe. Or, at least, some of them... Is it the same for Murder on the Orient Express ? If so, how much do the public actually know ? Why doesn't it have more consequences on Poirot's reputation ?

&amp;#x200B;

That's it. A small thing I notices, thought it might interest some people."

"Best post-Doyle author who picked up the reins and carried on the Sherlock Holmes universe? I‚Äôve recently finished the canon, and am not quite ready to quit yet! Who do you think is/was the best at keeping the original spirit of Holmes and Watson alive?"
"This sub doesn't have much going on, so as a new fan, I'm going to keep posting my opinions as I finish stories. Just finished ""The A.B.C. Murders"" Well, unlike with ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"", I avoided any information on this one. I just decided on it next by sorting by rating on goodreads. So I knew nothing else about it. I don't even know if it's held in that high regard, as I noticed the rating was high, but the number of ratings was significantly lower than a lot of others (something like 90k vs 250k). 

I didn't figure this one out before the ending like previously. I did consider that someone was manipulating Cust, but Christie suckered me right along with Poirot's ""It could have been a woman"", and the phone call to Cust. I didn't however suspect it would be as simple as the two women it seemed most likely to be (Thora or Lily (though Lily being given so little time in the spotlight, I thought maybe an accomplice, which was dashed instantly when Hastings suggested it, because then I was sure Christie was basically poking fun at readers who fell for it.)) I also doubted whether there was another. The setup seemed a bit more outlandish than the more intimate murders of the other works I've finished, and I'm not sure all the talk of luck really justified just how impossible the setup seemed, regardless of how much sense it made when everything came together. So when we got Cust's POV after the botched D murder, I then thought for a short bit that maybe Christie was trying something different and instead of a whodunit she was going more for the mystery being how he'd be caught and why, but it didn't seem right. There were too many hints that hadn't come together by the time they started chasing Cust.

I also did suspect Clarke for a second, when Cust mentioned a salary, and something in the back of my head (maybe my own little gray cells), said ""Even with suggestion, how would the culprit finance all the travel and the setup? Fraser couldn't afford to take Betty out more than twice a week, and nobody else is that well off. Thora may have gotten gifts from Car Clarke, but not dead Clarke is the only person we've really seen a lot of with money to burn. Still, I have to admit that unlike with Sheppard, I wasn't pointing the finger at him at the end. 

Nope, this time I got got. I didn't have a proper answer and just decided to read on and see what happens. The only reason I really knew it wasn't just Cust being that given how out of it he seemed when we got his perspective, I didn't see him being of mind to write such taunting letters. 

I'm not sure how I feel about ""The A.B.C. Murders"", it was very entertaining, and it got me, but it was such a departure from the last three, that when Poirot started listing clues found pointing to Clarke, I thought ""In another version of this story, that could have been a novel in and of itself"". It was different, and much more... heady? maybe not the word. It felt much more modern in it's scope than the traditional whodunit. (Of course, lots of things still antiquated, I found the idea of ""People don't kill strangers without reason"" somewhat funny, imagining Poirot trying to logic out the madness of some later serial killers, but one has to take account of the schools of thought prevalent at the time of writing). 

All said and done, I didn't enjoy it as much as Ackroyd or Death on the Nile due to the absurdness of the complexity of the scheme, but I still enjoyed it very much, and can see why it's well regarded. 

Next up is either the start or the end: The Mysterious Affair at Styles, or Curtain. The Mysterious Affair at Styles is the next on the list as far as order by rating, but I have to admit, I find myself wanting to read Curtain, just because I've become somewhat attached to Poirot's character more than the mysteries, and want to see how Agatha Christie in her dislike of him by that point, decided to send him off. Would it be a bad idea to read Curtain next? Does it spoil any earlier works?

Or, is there a better reading order here? I don't know if order of publication is also chronological order, and I'm afraid to look stuff up for fear of being spoiled. I don't usually care for reading things in order of release.

Edit: 

Completed the following:

Murder on the Orient Express

Death on the Nile

The Murder of Roger Ackroyd

The A.B.C. Murders (clearly)

And made the mistake of watching the first four episodes of the series so have kind of had those spoiled for me (but am hoping I'll forget them by the time I get back around to them, though don't think I'll be able to, as at least two of those episodes left enough of an impression that they made me start this reading journey)."

And if there is any, how did he know that he has to lose weight?

"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 3 The three of us repaired to the cottage from whence I went off to the radio building. I instructed young Gill to bring in the others and to ask Hauser if he was up to creating something to assuage the hunger of eight plus one. Gill solved the first by ringing the camp's dinner bell. The second he proceeded to aid by lighting the stove and putting water to boil.

The atmosphere at the cottage was strained at best. Both occupants had done what they could to undo the damage inflicted by a night in the rain. For all he was worth Sherlock was at sea about what to do with Miss Adler - or how to answer the most immediate question... was she a threat to the colony? I felt it incumbent upon myself to put him at ease, at least to the best I was able.
.
I was unaware of Sherlock's encounter with Irene Adler prior to it being released to the public by Dr. Watson. I confess the account gave me cause to smile at the time because I knew of her through my professional capacity. She had been diplomatically introduced to my office by American officials several years before. I had never made her acquaintance and she, therefore, would have realized no connection between the brothers Holmes. She probably gave Sherlock no particular thought other than as an agent in the employ of the King of Bohemia. However, there must have been some attraction prompting her to speak to him in the street - or, possibly, she simply couldn't resist the jape.

Through inquiries I learned the hasty marriage to the barrister Godfrey Norton had been arranged to provide Miss Adler travel with another passport under a new identity. Her New Jersey birthplace 'inadvertently' became Jersey. 

The King's liaison with Adler was more bravado and braggadocio than actual fact. He enjoyed having the young woman on his arm and in the lascivious speculation of his male circle. His concern for his reputation was valid. But he, not she, was the prompt of those possible stains.

He presumed Adler's quick marriage and departure from England was evidence of her intimidation by him. In actuality she had received instructions from her American masters to hasten to Rome. They felt need to understand the ramifications of the 'Prisoners of the Vatican' issue.

The title-name on her dossier with my office was 'eagle' which is the English translation for the German, adler. Many times her whereabouts became unknown to us, but some person who could have been her would draw attention in a foreign capitol, busy port, or major city. Many times information would be passed along from our American brethren which might have originated from a source with her credentials. She was never removed from our books but, for what we knew, she could have died on numerous occasions or been moldering in a dank cell somewhere. Dr. Watson believed her deceased.

Norton had his nuptials to Adler annulled and celebrated a more customary wedding 17 months later to the daughter of a judge. He is now himself a judge - with an occasional brief from Whitehall. I informed the pair that we could expect to be fed shortly, then I put my attention to our guest. ""Miss Adler, you may not know me but please believe I know much about you."" Sherlock's gaze fell on me. ""I need to know several things from you. The first is, are you here by chance or by choice?""

""More choice than chance."", she admitted. ""I am privy to some particularly delicate information which I must pass along to US officials. I had refused to believe the announcement of Sherlock Holmes' retirement. I trusted if I found him he could provide help. Examining the coastal maps I reasoned if I were looking for a place where no-one would think to find me it would be in this general region. Should that have proved wrong I could still make my way to the Shorncliffe Camp although that is where my pursuers expected me to be heading. In fact that is how I gained my advantage. They thought I'd cross the Strait at Calais, but I chose Wissant instead. It was still very close.

""I am hesitant to interrupt your very valid questions, but I have one for you Mr. Holmes, do you have a way to forward my information to London? It is important.""

""I believe we can help you solve that problem, Miss Adler."" I replied. At that moment the mess bell rang for its usual purpose.

"Just finished ""Murder on the Links"", I don't know if I'm getting better at figuring things out, or if I'm exactly where Christie wants me to be. (Spoilers) So, I planned to take a bit longer on this one, enjoy it slowly. But That only lasted the first couple chapters. By the time I was about 1/3rd through, I didn't want to stop.

I felt the most clever I've felt so far reading this one. I was able to guess at a lot of things before they came to light. I figured out the message in the victim's pocket being for Jack (I'm using victim because three people with the same surname and the victim having two names). I figured that the situation wasn't an affair but blackmail and pieced together victim's true identity almost immediately after that past was introduced, and so the reason for the blackmail fell into place. 

I guessed that the illusive sister was the one with a connection to Jack immediately as well. I couldn't think of another reason to introduce a sister and never have her around, narratively, other than for that reveal or the subversion of that idea. I didn't think Christie would be so obvious as to do double-switcheroo at that point. 

 I felt like I had a handle on everything this time... right up until the actual murderer was revealed, and once again, I felt dumb, because of course there was a third level to that backstory and I stopped at level two and patted myself on the back for seeing through Christie's red herring, only for it to flip around and the red herring be the solution. 

I also suspected the faked death thing due to how obvious the setup is at the start, but I was really waiting for some miraculous reveal that the victim had somehow pulled it off like he had some twin or something crazy like that (Silly I know, but wouldn't surprise me).

So yeah, I don't know if I was more clever this time, or if Christie just lead me by the nose right up until the reveal. 

Some other thoughts not about the main whodunit aspect: I was not expecting Hastings to meet his wife in the second published novel. I knew from osmosis that he gets married at some point, but I also thought his bad luck with women would be some kind of running gag given the way ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" ended. 

I also thought the part about Hastings being antagonistic to Poirot was really fascinating, because I haven't seen a perspective of Poirot from someone who views him as an adversary but doesn't belittle his talents yet. And I really enjoyed it because it drove home how absolutely terrifying it would be to have Poirot as an enemy. Sure, Poirot knew Hastings wasn't actually an enemy, and all would be revealed, to even have Hastings think Poirot was on the opposite side, and illustrate how weary he had to be of every move Poirot makes or doesn't make, was fascinating. 

Lastly,

I watched ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" episode. And have to say, it was so much better than ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" episode. It felt so much more faithful to the original telling, down to exact lines verbatim being spoken at points. Really felt like they cut no corners there. That said, I'm starting to realize that while Suchet does book Poirot wonderfully, series Hastings is a little too dry compared to his book counterpart. While book Hastings is dull compared to Poirot, it's very clearly just because Poirot is brilliant. Hastings puts things together and can be witty and is actually quite good at reading people and their reactions, even if he doesn't connect the dots for all the reasons behind them. He's not a dullard. The show however, makes Hastings about as clever as a slice of white bread, and about as entertaining. He doesn't do much but serve as the character Poirot has to spell everything out for. I get why he's like that, just feel it's a bit of a shame that his book version is so much more of a person.

Next up is ""Murder Under the Sun"", then ""Elephants Can Remember"" or ""Five Little Pigs""."

What are your thoughts on this? Like-- this is kind of James Moriaty - - but like... How? XD
Who‚Äôs your favorite Sherlock Holmes cast? I personally think Jeremy Brett did the closest-to-the-book portrayal. The intensity and quirkiness are hard to maintain for a long range of time and he did such a great job from surface expressions to energy. Some people think he‚Äôs too dark or harsh but I don‚Äôt think Holmes is a soft character in any respect. Rathbone Basil‚Äôs portray for example is a bit too neurotypical for me. Not that Holmes has to be neurotic but I think that‚Äôs more of what Conan Doyle intended.

The House of Fear 1945 movie trailer Sherlock Holmes Plot: Sherlock Holmes investigates a series of deaths at a castle with each foretold by the delivery of orange pips to the victims.
"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 8 Sherlock, Miss Adler, Blocke, and I were gathered in the cottage. ""I have given you a copy of the report I will present in London. It states a summary of our collective impressions of what we found in Essen and from Krupp himself. In essence it paints a picture of a country dressing up for a party and, once attired, may feel an obligation to attend. They could talk themselves into war before they even know it.

""Certainly, Herr Krupp does not speak for all of the German upper class, but independent evidence collaborates our overview.

""They perceive the decline of the Ottoman Empire as a potential vacancy in a child's game of musical chairs. And they are all fattening their bottoms to take the seat.

""Those with proven expertise in one arena have come to believe that one, singular accomplishment has vouchsafed them with an expertise in all. From that vantage they talk with conviction on matters they know nothing about. They speak but do not listen. They are all swimming in currents too swift for them, but are too full of themselves to recognize the peril.

""It pains me to include in this report that the UK is not within the German field of vision. They presume we will not take sides. I say 'pains' because it will allow our own willfully myopic decision makers to reciprocate in kind.

""But perhaps they are correct. We are charged with observation and assessment not with policy making. The prevailing sentiment is that our government will reject German alliance overtures not because Germany poses a threat to Britain but, to the contrary, because she does not pose a threat.

""On the positive ledger there do exist vocal advocates for peaceful coexistence. Franz Ferdinand of Austria is one. We may hope he and his like-minded fellows prevail.""

.

Although the recent adventure remained in the minds of those involved, we did have other matters at hand.

So far, the only resident not accounted to you, dear reader, is Rice. Without hesitation I would commend him as the most diligent and most critical of our permanent staff. Rice is collator, referencer, and indexer. He looks for patterns, repetitions, anomalies. He brings order to chaos. 

At a time when Sherlock was dealing with individual cases it was more than sufficient for him alone to rely on his prodigious capacity to recall facts and infer connections. In the global milieu in which he now operates that would be impossible, not to mention, impractical. In addition, Sherlock was now part of a team of which I am one and Miss Adler might unanticipatingly become another. We needed access to the information coming into the colony to the same extent as Sherlock. Rice allows that facility.

It was he who brought to our attention the tensions between Serbia and Albania.

.

Our full compliment was seated at the center table of the mess. Sherlock had drawn out a rough map of Europe on the white tablecloth. He was moving around our mismatched pepper mills. At each shift one of our number or another would make an observation prompting a retreat to the earlier position or a movement of yet another piece. On occasion, Pencer, our radio operator would push or plunk down a copper from several he had in hand.

After half an hour of this exercise, young Gill, our indispensable factotum, arose and walked full around the table, his concentration on the map. He had been silent to this point and reticent in his usual way. Without a word he poured salt on one of the lines. Belgium had just fallen to Germany.

It took another hour for everyone to agree to the likelihood of this scenario. The next several days would be dedicated to planning where best to deploy our resources to monitor its validity. The irregulars would be on the move.

""Our friend Herr Krupp is owner of Germaniawerft in Kiel, which is Germany‚Äôs main warship builder. And we must not forget, the firm has built the first German U-boat. I believe we must discover if production at that plant is on the rise. A sea vessel is not something one orders today and takes delivery on tomorrow.""

"Childhood memory of a creepy Poirot episode I distinctly remember this one scene in some random Poirot episode which aired on television around 2008 (might be an older episode) as a child. I think the scene was in the context of a flashback memory, in some type of school for boys/girls (might be completely wrong). There was an old creepy looking woman that was taking children to a room and abusing them/hitting them with something? I remember it as being pretty traumatic seeing this as I was just a little kid, and I also vividly remember a shot of the old woman in a bathtub/bed possibly dead? 

I might be completely off here, but it‚Äôs worth a shot, might not even be Poirot at all. do you guys have any idea what episode this might be?

Thanks"

"Poirot audiobooks read by David Suchet and Hugh Fraser Hello fellow Poirot fans! As we approach the fall and continue the quarantine in many places around the world, I know I‚Äôm especially excited to revisit the David Suchet series. If you‚Äôre looking to get more Poirot but don‚Äôt necessarily have time to sit down and read or watch, I highly recommend the audiobooks read by David Suchet and Hugh Fraser. They both have amazing range as voice actors, and it‚Äôs so fun to hear Suchet reprise his role and go deeper into the source material. It‚Äôs also especially fun to hear Fraser do his good friend Poirot. Suchet‚Äôs performance of Death on the Nile is amazing, and my favorite from Fraser is Murder on the Links.

They‚Äôre all available on the subscription service Scribd, which is around $9 a month the last time I checked and a good value if you intend to listen to them all (find them by searching for the actors‚Äô names, Scribd categorizes audiobooks by narrator in addition to author and title). They‚Äôre also available for standalone purchase from Audible, and I‚Äôd assume they‚Äôre also on public library platforms like Overdrive. Happy listening to you!"

"Sherlock Holmes and The Spider Woman 1943 movie trailer Plot: Sherlock Holmes investigates a series of so-called ""pajama suicides"". He knows the female villain behind them is as cunning as Moriarty and as venomous as a spider."
"(The series on Netfilx.) I‚Äôm exactly 2 seasons in and still can‚Äôt tell wether I love or hate Moriaty. One thing‚Äôs for sure, though. I kinda love his cute sing-song voice that he sometimes speaks in. Anyone here agree?"
"God willing, one day I, too, will be described as ""unorthodox and theatrical"" by a huffy government intelligence officer (Sherlock Homes and the Voice of Terror, 1942)"
"Chateau Neuf du Pape, season 10, and not better for it. Wow. At 10 I summered in Hong Kong. I loathed the Country Club where my mother and her family spent each day acting like they were acting  in a BBC version of ‚ÄúThe Americans.‚Äù 

I found solace exploring Victoria Peak where we stayed, about half way to the top, and the vibrant, imagination candy of the downtown ‚ÄúCentral‚Äù district. Kowloon, via Star Ferry, or Macau by hydrophilic boat all close at hand.

I began reading Poirot novels that summer. Sitting on the edge of some back alley stairs that led to yet another back alley and taking Dim Sum w my uncles driver, Tony, who I thought was Bruce Lee. My uncle Charlie was Far East CEO of, at the time, AIU, now AIG.

I loved Hercule and Hastings and the notion of Christies that the chickens of Empire would come home to roost. Her characters were mostly appalling classists suspicious of any foreigner. I was young but a reader, so I knew her books written in the early and mid 30‚Äôs were filled w Mosley style, fascist Brits and Americans who were clearly pro-German. The way she used the Great War to remind us of wars reality was spot on. I loved the Poirot books until the final few. By 9th grade, I had moved on to Chandler, Innes, Ross M., etc.

I had never watched the TV show until quite recently. While I enjoyed season one and two, despite the overdoing of la motif de camp, and allowed myself a guilty pleasure. After all, they were made before the TV evolution around le fin fe siecle. Before the the Sopranos, Lost, BB, The Wire and Shield, Madmen, Line of Duty, Spooks et al. 

Then, my Amazon prime account forced a jump from the end of season 3 all the way to season 9. 

Jesus fucking Christ old bean, what great things had happened!!! Every thing from Art direction, locations, the suddenly excellent writing and as Hercule might say, ‚Äú the running of the show..,‚Äù
all of it. 

As if they looked at ‚ÄúMidsomer‚Äù and the success of other exceeding smart shows like ‚ÄúSherlock,‚Äù and ‚ÄúThe Worriker Trilogy‚Äù and jumped on board. Usually the best work is done in the first 6 or so series. So too I thought that it would be avec Poirot.

Imagine my surprise when I was blown away by seasons 10-12, where I sit and poke this into my phone like a thirsty crackhead. I felt compelled to say that while the early seasons are good, so far the dozen or so episodes Ive watched have been like a different, better rendering of life among the pre WWII rural haute bourgeoisie than almost anything I‚Äôve watched.

Great job all! Thank you. So dark, each installment is, that ‚Äúthe finding of the torch‚Äù shines its light on many truths long kept in the potting shed. Not just on ‚Äúwhodunnit.‚Äù

I have a just turned 18 year old bairn, I cannot imagine allowing him to roam the streets of HK, 1976, alone with pickets stuffed with Wan. I mean, if I could find a pay phone and call Tony, all of Fu Manchu‚Äôs triad would certainly have scattered to the docks and the boat people I was told never to make eye contact with. Of course I did, met a family who lived on a wee unmapped Island, the father Kwon had webbed feet, and I would take their wee son, about seven or so to the movies, Tiger Balm Gardens, etc. I remembered crying on the DC 10 when we headed off for a week in Bangkok before returning home to NYC. Thank God I had Hercule and a mother who knew I could handle myself.

Great show, all."

"Devil's Daughter Sucks Starting with awful UI design is very simple and not appropriate for the genre combination to graphics and cringy political propaganda that you would expect to see in every modern game, which makes you feel like developers consider you to be dumb and not notice it, and that you are paying your money to receive some propaganda, for your own money. This is like paying to get beaten in a dark alley. 19th century, you see a black woman, a rich black woman, in england. free. by her own, without a man. Ultra combo. This can almost be now considred a ""social science fiction"". I loved the crimes and punishments for how realistically the epoch and society was portrayed. Oh my... I am so tired of this modern trend of revisionism made by dumb ultra-leftist radicals and sponsors of marxism.

The graphics...Excessive auto-exposure in games never does good, and just in the first location, in sherlock's house auto exposure makes the scene brighter than needed. It doesn't feel like the game had any effort put in it, visual style is horrible.

The also changed Watson. Why? I hate when characters get replaced.

What I expect from a sequel is the same damn game but with new stories. I don't want that yellow design, this is a dark criminal investigations game, in a dark rainy london, not gta 5. I wander why, why they had to change everything that much. To show that they have done some work?  
Or because of dumb angry gamers that would call it a ""dlc"" because they didn't change the UI?  


The character even moves now not so quality. Damn, even controls suck. And the walking animation is cringy, the repetitivenes is very obvious, looks unnatural. And they literally should have just not ""fix"" what already works,  


The game has no soul now. It is not that dark london game. Sherlock is not a stylish english  gentleman, even watson has been changed to some kind of a jerk-like looking asshole"
"Poirot: why's he your favorite? I'm a big Poirot fan, and still refuse to acknowledge the last book : ) I love his fastidiousness, his kindness, and his friendship with Hastings. And his summer traveling suits and outfits. 

I like how sweet Hastings is, and how they both have a great dynamic with Miss Lemon, and with Japp. I wish Christie had kept him 'eternally' working with time seemingly frozen -- like Nero Wolfe, for example.

I also love the music of the tv series -- does anyone know if it's on cd? I looked on youtube but didn't find much. "

"Is there a list of Poirot stories not covered by the Suchet Series (If there are any)? I have a problem with Poirot (well all mystery series). I can read first and watch second, but I can't do the reverse, as the time commitment to a mystery novel where I already know who dun it is a major turn off for me.

On the flip side though, I watched a few episodes of Poirot randomly and love it, and want to hurry and binge the whole series. 

Knowing how long the series is, I'm not sure how many stories weren't covered, or if there are any, and if there are if they're any good. Honestly, hoping there are quite a few so I can binge the series while still having a healthy reading list. 

Does anyone know if such a list exists? A quick googling wasn't very helpful."

"Dead Man's Folly I just watched *Dead Man's Folly*, and, never having read the novel, am confused about a couple of plot points:

Are we to assume that Etienne de Sousa was just a patsy-of-opportunity?  It seemed clear that the villains didn't know exactly when he'd arrive until he showed up.  What if he hadn't shown up until the next day?  Did they have a backup patsy and plan?

Are we to believe that Merdell was the only person in the neighborhood of Nasse House who recognized Sir George's true identity?

How much time passed between Marlene Tucker's first blackmail attempt against Sir George and her getting whacked?  It seems like it must have been long enough to pull together the plans for the garden fete to use as the cover for the murder and to pull together the plans for faux-Hattie to disappear.  How plausible is it that Sir George had full confidence that Marlene would keep her mouth shut, payoff or no payoff, until he could get her whacked?  Also, he obviously figured out that Marlene was getting her information from Merdell.  How would he have had confidence that Merdell wouldn't have told anyone else?  It seems like a better plan would have been to grab up Marlene, stash her somewhere on the property, arrange for a note to be delivered to Merdell before anyone realized Marlene was missing demanding that he show up somewhere if he ever wanted to see her again, rough him up when he showed up to verify that he hadn't blabbed to anyone else, whack both of them, put the bodies in the boat house, drive to London with faux-Hattie, and be off to the continent before anyone even realized that Merdell and Marlene were missing."

"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 5 It was agreed, all matters would best be continued on the following day.

At breakfast, again in the cottage, Miss Adler proceeded to tell her story.

""I have financial contacts all over Europe who would advise me of clandestine transfers of large sums of money. I would make it known to the involved parties that I knew of these payments and infer that I knew their purpose. The impression conveyed would appear to be a clumsy effort of extortion. In fact, the intent was to determine the identity and number of those thugs I expected would be dispatched to silence me. That illumination and further investigation many times would provide an answer to the original question or, at least, supply a large piece to the puzzle. Flight would signal to my targets that I was intimidated and would no longer be a threat.

""Most recently I was going through my usual performance when it began to look as though multiple streams might be merging to form a river. My loyal watchers informed me of three pursuers when I left Dresden. Rather than retiring, that number reached eight at Strassburg. It did not abate, but only swelled when I crossed into France. From that point I did not look back.

""Something very large is in the offing, and I have no idea what it is.""

.

Word had come back to the colony identifying Miss Adler's pursuers. All of those killed by the Shorncliffe troops were not street thugs or common ruffians but assassins.

""We are seeing similar activity."", remarked Sherlock. ""Aggressive  repression is definitely on the rise in parts of Europe. A veneer of 'the usual' masks a great deal of turbulence beneath the surface. Until we know more, though, let us discuss your immediate ambitions.""

""Allow me, please, to preface this 'interview', if you will, by apprising you that, although I was born in the United States, my parents were both British. Furthermore, I appreciate that the US and Great Britain, even when striving for the same ends, needs follow their separate paths. In short, I would feel no conflict offering what talents I have to your purpose. If my efforts bear fruit, and you wish to share them with the US, that would be your decision.


Sherlock and I decided a serendipitous opportunity to test Miss Adler's skills was presently at hand. We would send her to Baker Street to meet with our Strasbourg banker. The trip would allow her to replenish her wardrobe as well.

The following morning Sherlock set her down to undergo his deft hand at disguise. She would have liked to bridle, but had the sense not to. She had been provided with more appropriate travel attire, more banknotes than we thought necessary, and a letter of introduction to Mrs. Hudson. At 11am she was escorted through the clover field by Rice. They found the docile roan who was awarded a honey covered apple for his patience. Miss Adler mounted and was sent on her way.

She did not return the following day as we expected. Nor the next. Sherlock and I took alternate turns at being irritated and concerned. She was back on the third. Her tardiness, she explained, owed to her severing employment with her former masters, making her purchases, and a full day spent with the banker. Before we could hear what that entailed she allowed that Gill must be sent to retrieve some boxes left where she and the roan parted company.

The banker was not privy to those transactions already logged by Miss Adler, but he was aware of investments made by un-named third parties to armament manufacturers. The amounts coincided identically with those on her list. She provided us with a written report of the particulars.

The three of us discussed further lines of inquiry. That these were investments rather than purchases hinted at an expectation of increased future need rather than immediate demand. It needed to be determined at each of the companies - if there was a current expansion of the workforce, if additional raw materials were on order, and if new facilities were under construction. Other related industries, not on the banker's list, needed to be looked at.

Sherlock sent these questions to his German agents. He predicted answers would be back within a week. 

Returned:

The Krupp works in Essen, producers of steel, artillery, ammunition, and other armaments - new buildings under construction. No new hiring, no surplus materials.

DWM, Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken, manufacturers of the Luger pistol and the Mauser rifle. Both the munitions plant in Baden and the weapons plant in Berlin - new buildings under construction. No new hiring, no surplus materials. 

The casting of a wider net revealed the same story for three similar Austrian firms, Skoda, Schwarzlose, and Steyr Mannlicher.

.

I would report these findings to London in person. I was due back in any case. Sherlock affirmed he would concentrate greater resources to the matter. Miss Adler, who had yet to have a set role assigned to her, would be put together with Blocke our resident linguist and cultural expert. They would search for nuances and subtleties which might explain a prompt for broadened production. The two German firms, particularly, enjoyed a huge export trade. Perhaps they could see trouble brewing in regions we were missing. Perhaps they were looking to exploit a market which did not yet exist.

.

The universal reaction I obtained in London was that these activities were indeed cause for concern, but probably more for the neighboring countries than for us. Nothing from sources other than the colony gave my arguments additional weight.

"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 14 This entry was supplied by Wallace...

The colony was between training sessions and it was coming on to Christmas. The brothers Holmes are not averse to a bit of gaiety - but, with all respect, one wouldn't expect or want them to organize it. Furthermore, a celebration of sentimentality would be completely out of the question. So it happened that preparations for the holiday fell to Hauser, Blocke, Rice, Pencer, Stewart, and myself.

Pencer and I justified the procurement of the latest recording and playing instrument from the Victor Talking Machine Co. as a 'gift' for the whole community. Several cylinders by the world famous tenor Enrico Caruso were earmarked for Miss Adler. 

Hauser became a man possessed. If the pages formulated for London were lengthy and secret, those were nothing compared to the recipes (we could only suppose) being husbanded by our cook. He locked them away at night. His weekly food requisition doubled - and the occasion was still a fortnight away.

Stewart volunteered to make centerpieces for the dining table and side tables. Blocke and Rice became as secretive as Hauser.

The principals were informed there would be a special dinner and everyone would be expected to contribute an 'entertainment'.

Blocke and Rice added Miss Adler to their intrigue.

.

All members of the colony had been warned away from the mess building for the morning of Christmas day. Light breakfast had been left at our doors. Only two people, Hauser and Stewart, moved inside the forbidden building, and the various aromas which made their escape tortured us and made us salivate with anticipation.

On the stroke of 1 pm. the dinner bell rang. No one was too far afield to miss it. We crowded in and were dazzled. Garlands of evergreen draped about the room. Red ribbons, holly, and dozens of lit candles created a storybook tableau of what Christmas should look like. It was picture perfect - not too much, nor too little, nothing garish, everything tasteful and warm. The centerpiece of the dining table was a work of art.

Hauser and Steward were setting out pat√©, terrine, prawn cocktail cups with Marie Rose sauce and smoked salmon with horseradish, cr√®me fra√Æche &amp; beetroot.

Aside: if the reader thinks I could identify all of these enticing 'starters' he would be sorely in error. Hauser provided me with a menu after the fact.

Second aside: I was in such awe of the culinary delights and the room's enchanting transformation I almost failed to notice that everyone was starched, and trimmed, and combed. As my mother would say, ""They cleaned up nice.""

On the main table were various bottles of wine and a delicious honey mead fermented here at the compound by Hauser. (He used it to bribe the men who delivered our stores from the Shorncliffe Camp to insure we received the freshest of the fresh produce.) Also available were raspberry Champagne cocktail and cranberry, fresh pear and cinnamon bubbles.

If we thought the entr√©es could not be surpassed, we were open to be bowled well over.

Third aside: Only in America is the entr√©e the main meal. In French cuisine, and in every other part of the world, an entr√©e is a prelude to a larger course within a single meal.

Plates were cleared for the main course - mustard butter-basted roast turkey with bacon and roast beef with Yorkshire puddings. The sides were parsnips, honey-roasted carrots, potatoes, and the traditional pigs-in-blankets and bacon, sausage, and prune rolls. The sauces were port &amp; cranberry sauce with juniper, and gravy.

.

Dinner was complete, the table cleared and pushed to the side, and the dishware were put to soak. Miss Adler insisted everyone take a stroll to aid digestion and walk off the lethargy induced by eating too much. We would return for dessert, a thought inconceivable at the time.

It was a beautiful, crisp, but not cold, afternoon. The lady's countermeasure proved itself by the time we returned to the mess. Plum pudding, homemade custard, and royal cherry trifle might just be considered.

Pencer and I set up the phonograph and played a Caruso aria conducted by Walter B. Rogers while the party settled themselves with drinks and tobacco. Miss Adler was quite pleased with the music.

It was time for the entertainment.

Mycroft arose and addressed the group. ""My reservoir of amusements is meager at best, so I beg you not to mind if I borrow a tale from my brother's good friend and Boswell, Dr. Watson. It was never consigned to print because it featured the doctor himself. So, it will be new to you all, and perhaps even to Sherlock. It is a bit risqu√©. In advance I beg your forgiveness.""

I cannot relate Mycroft's telling in full, but it was delivered superbly.

.

In short... Late one night the doctor was called to certify the apparent death of a bishop. When he arrived at the manse, the priest's housekeeper was in a state approaching hysteria and a cleric, who introduced himself as the secretary, was not much improved. Watson was led upstairs to the bedrooms. Entering the door indicated he saw instantly what had affected the aforementioned pair.

On a very large four poster bed was a corpulent male body, presumably the bishop, looking quite dead. The shocking element, however, was that he was handcuffed to two young women - one on each wrist. The women were trying to cover themselves as best they could and, at the same time, trying to move as far from the dead man as best they could.

Knowing as he uttered the question it had been asked already, ""Where is the key?""

""He swallowed it,"" one of the ladies answered.

""We were sampling some of the church wine. He became tipsy, said he felt like he'd died and gone to heaven, laughed, popped the key into his mouth, took another sip of wine and swallowed both wine and key. A minute later he just stopped breathing and, and he died,"" She gave a shiver and a sob with the last.

Immediately ruling out most options because of scandal, Watson directed the secretary to wake the nearest blacksmith and bring back a hacksaw - without the blacksmith.

While the secretary was gone, Watson did what he could to confirm the key was not lodged in the bishop's throat. He introduced himself to the comely pair. They, in turn, identified themselves as Chalice and Grail Throckton. They proudly admitted to being in charge of arranging the chapel flowers.

Examining the deceased for the key entailed some difficulty due to the springing of the bed, the girth of the gentleman, and the proximity of the ladies. Finally convinced it was not retrievable, Watson regained the stability, and safety, of the floor.

It must have been soon, but seemed forever, the secretary returned with a hacksaw. Watson put him to work while the ladies argued about who was to be released first. The doctor and the secretary took turns at the cuffs. One was released but remained to wait for her sister. Freed, and clothed, they were sent home. Watson performed a more detailed examination of the body.

The good doctor was then faced with the more difficult task of confirming the cause of death. Scandal aside, he wasn't going to lie. Chalice and Grail, indeed! He mulled on the subject for a time and eventually he wrote, ""Cause of death, heart attack while in his cups."" Let anyone make of that as they would.

Our assembly laughed so hard we were in tears.

Next to come forth were Blocke and Rice. With concertina and recorder they regaled us with Once in Royal David's City, O Holy Night, and God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen. We all sang along.

Then Miss Adler joined the pair. A hush fell because it was known she had once been prima donna of the Imperial Opera of Warsaw.

There must have been a trick of light, but it was as though a spotlight fell upon her and she was the only person in the room. She sang the Coventry Carol and then the Wexford Carol. Her voice was still nothing shy of magnificent.

When the company had recovered from Miss Adler's spell, Sherlock stepped forward. ""I have nothing to offer this dedicated, hard working, congenial, selfless band but my most heartfelt admiration, and thanks."" As he said these words he unwrapped what was apparently a framed award or testament of some sort. ""You should be apprised it is not just I who hold these sentiments. What I have in my hands is the badge of the Order of St Michael and St George. Never before has it been bestowed upon a group of people - until now. Accompanying the award is this message, 'In full appreciation from a grateful nation for services rendered to the Crown' It bears the seal of King George V.""

The silver frame measured approximately 10 inches by 10 inches. The badge itself was a starburst affair. In the center was a depiction of St. George defeating the dragon and around that was a legend, 'Auspicium Melioris Aevi'. I found later the translation from Rice, ‚ÄòToken Of A Better Age‚Äò. It would hang in prominence on the mess wall for all to draw encouragement.

Not long thereafter members began to drift back to their respective quarters, apparently not wishing to diminish the magic of the day by refusing to let it end. It would never be forgotten by any of us.

Sherlock Holmes part 2. The madness goes on.
"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter the last Seated at the table where, months ago, Sherlock and I had spoken of rational sentiment I found Miss Adler. The second cottage was complete and, with a new coat of paint on both, now bore no hint it was an afterthought. There were flowers on the table.

""Miss Adler, are you taking an afternoon of much deserved relaxation?""

""Mr. Holmes, I am enjoying the day and you should as well. We have all been quite busy and there is every indication the opportunities to escape from our rigors will increasingly be more difficult to capture, at least in the near future.

""I have been mentally walking through one of my favorite mazes. As you know, our newest recruit, Wilson, formerly taught at a school for the deaf. He informs me that hand signing is actively discouraged in schools, and the emphasis in education is on forcing deaf children to learn to lip read and finger spell. He abandoned his position because the evidence suggests only thirty percent of normal speech can be visually speechread. The reason is because many spoken sounds are produced within the mouth and throat, and cannot be seen. In addition, many pairs look identical, such as 'p' and 'b'.

""I find that interesting, but only to the extent that the words people say often mean something else in any event. Listening to a long-married couple when they don't believe, or care, if they are overheard is a fine example. They communicate in a code developed over time. He complains the morning coffee is cold, but what he means is that he did not sleep well. She says she likes the tie he's wearing, but what she means is that she admires her husband. They finish each other's sentences. They convey much in silences.

""That may well be attributed to prolonged association, but strangers do it, too. Humans adopt the jargon of their trade, their social position, their gender, their culture.

""I wonder sometimes if moving past grunts and pointing has been that much of an advancement. And what about those who's first language is not vocal - those who speak through their art?

Sherlock, with the two hounds at his heels, was passing and, attracted by our conversation, he deigned to join us. 

""How pleasant. It's not often we converse on matters unrelated to the tasks at hand"", he said.

Miss Adler replied, ""I'm not sure we are very far afield. I think Mycroft's train of detection and my own run on parallel tracks. We listen, we look, and we judge if the observation of one affirms what is revealed by the other. We also wish to determine why people say what they do and act as they do. Does a man espouse a cause because he believes in it, or because it will do him some good? Does he trust because he believes, or is it that he hopes? When we have a true sense of why a person turns right instead of left we have an insight on what he will do next.""

""I cannot disagree. But for the vast number of those under our watchful eye it is a case of one foot following the other. Perhaps I am in danger of confusing simplistic with simple, but I look for patterns. Cause is not as critical for me.""

""That is why we are a good team, we compliment"", said Miss Adler.

I couldn't be sure if I was counted in the 'team' to which she referred. No matter. There was more discussion interspersed by comfortable interludes of silence. Sherlock became absorbed with bees which had strayed from the clover fields.

""I can sit and watch the bees for hours. Our middle European fellows, however, would undoubtedly draw different observations. What I witness is a ballet of cooperation. Whereas they would see a regimented hierarchy of plodders moving at the will of the queen. They would be incredulous that a monarchist such as myself could take away anything less.

""Do you know the queen is born a worker-bee and is nurtured into her role by other workers. In their egg state all bees are the same. A hive is almost egalitarian.

""I don't expect anyone would deny that the three of us possess exceptional talents, but the fact remains, we are all integral parts of a whole purpose, just as the bees first allegiance is to the hive.

""I'm quite certain I have a deserved reputation for not suffering fools, but I would myself be a fool if I rejected any contribution simply because it came from a source an elitist society might label the ‚Äòlower ranks‚Äò. I am not likely to forget it was our Gill as a young neophyte who set us on a significant path the colony now follows. Communities of men can achieve the totally unexpected when potential is allowed to demonstrate itself.‚Äù

I felt need to interject myself into this observation.

""I'd like to return to something Miss Adler was speaking of before you sat down. She questioned if moving past grunts and pointing has been that much of an advancement.

""Looking over the past century, the revolution of industry has allowed man to become almost god-like. With all of that, here we are spending our waking hours plumbing the possibilities of war - the ramifications of land war, sea war, under-sea war, can air war be the next?

""I worry what flaw exists in the grand scheme which demands the earthly scales keep heaven in balance with hell. At the end of this century will man have discovered a way to eradicate his entire race?

‚ÄúCan either of you put name to another species which, by its own volition, threatens its own extinction?‚Äù

.

The weeks and months which followed represented a dramatic expansion of activity - at the colony and away. Days with no respite were frequent. Keeping track of internecine conflicts on the continent was increasingly daunting as the candles of reason flickered.

Miss Adler‚Äôs pupil numbers were increased from three to six per indoctrinal term. Boggs began instructing his own brood of auditors. Rice needed a cartographer and a referencer. Hauser needed a sous chef (I didn‚Äôt know what that entailed except it represented another body). Pencer needed ‚Äúwhatever help‚Äù we could afford to him. Wallace and Blocke filled in as best they could but to the neglect of their own specialties. We were strained at every seam. 

Sherlock had long been consumed with a certain German by the name of Von Bork who maintained a residence in Harwich on the Essex coast.. Von Bork was an intimate of Baron Von Herling, the chief secretary of the German legation at Prussia House in London.

For the purpose of enhancing the persona he played with Von Bork Sherlock had cultivated a goatee. Miss Adler claimed he looked positively rakish. It was good to see the colony had not lost its capacity for humor.

Meanwhile I could not find release from the dichotomy of irrational preparation for irrational war. The Royal Naval Dockyard at Rosyth, Scotland had been allocated ¬£3,250,000 in 1903. It had not begun construction until 1909. It would not be functional until 1916.

Initially, Whitehall had to be forced fed the information we generated. Now they demanded everything we could deliver to them ‚Äì and were dismayed when informed they couldn‚Äôt have it yesterday.

.

The little table outside of the paired cottages had become a hub of sorts where Miss Adler, Sherlock, and I would discuss and dissect all manner of things from the practical to the abstract. Matters affecting the colony were usually addressed in the mess with the members of the colony, and we three went out of our way to not be, or appear to be, autocratic. However, on this occasion in late July of 1914, we were at the table ruminating over the fate of the colony. Our portfolio was fast outgrowing the facility and the reasonable recourse would be to either move it or break it up. To a large extent, though, it owed its success in no small measure to where it was and the chemistry which had developed between the residents. It was decided to bring the problem to the mess for full airing. Taking the permanent residents away from their tasks all at the same time was more than problematic but there was no other recourse.

Miss Adler expressed the problem to our company. Over several hours we entertained various solutions along with individual hesitations and objections. I kept being reminded of Sherlock‚Äôs rational sentiment revelation. Not being a permanent resident I was able to maintain a slight reserve, but I could tell Hauser was shaken by the prospect of dissolving the band. The rest had their own feelings but professionalism prevented them from any exhibition.

Our members were devoted to maintaining the standards they set for themselves. There were no easy jobs here but everyone enjoyed what they did. In addition, although a cause might be difficult to articulate or to reconcile, it was not so much that the colony was greater than the individuals who comprised it, but that each, and I do count myself, was better for being part of it.

Ironically, it was Hauser‚Äôs question from many moons past which finally set us on the right path ‚Äì ‚Äú...would you really need your man to 'live in'?‚Äù

We set to making lists in each division of what could be done elsewhere, stored elsewhere, taught elsewhere. We could shunt many tasks to many locations, in many cases with fewer restrictions. Each of our principals would groom counterparts. Under the guidance of suitable instructors leagues of cadets could be produced following our model. We would train trainers.

The colony‚Äôs dilemma was satisfied in the same remarkable fashion which, over our time together, we had come to appreciate and to depend upon. It would adapt and evolve, as all things must.

.

And so, I must bring this short chronicle to a close because it, too, is in jeopardy of outgrowing its intended purpose. Historians will attempt to explain how the world arrived at such a perilous state. I‚Äôll leave it to them. My self appointed task has merely been to record the efforts of one small assembly to construct a bulwark against the forces of bedlam. I have dipped my pen into the river of time and you have seen the result. Thanks to the good Dr. Watson you may be familiar with much that went before and, by the time this narrative has become available, you will probably be aware of what comes after.

No matter, I will keep finding excuses to pry myself away from London, board the Great Eastern Railway, and wend my way to the colony. My Pall Mall lodgings and the Diogenes Club are eminently comfortable but, oddly, I feel most content after giving over my safety to a roan with a penchant for honey covered apples.
