So i just finished the book and just finished watching the 2010 version of Murder on the Orient Express.

I know how the book ends, but i'm confused on the this movies adaptation. I have been trying to look up explanations but no luck. I have read that Poirot does end up telling the police a different story, letting the passengers go free.

What i saw was poirot leaving, pulling out his rosary. I interpreted it as it was up to us to conclude what Poirot presented to the police and whether or not the passengers were arrested.

How did everyone conclude they were free?

Please help, im not good at interpreting haha

Thanks!","SPOILER!!!!

0,"Why does Poirot always... Don't get me wrong, I adore the Belgian detective ... but why does he always convince people to kill themselves?

And in *Peril at End House*, he lets the culprit overdose on cocaine--hell, he's the one who gives her the cocaine for that specific purpose!! I get that prison isn't ideal, but Poirot straight up encourages them to do it, and when they do he treats it like a mercy. I get that he's just following his idea of justice, but it's kind of a bummer when you think about it. Especially compared to other detectives.

Then 5 minutes in they show Paul Renauld who (surprise, surprise) is played by the same actor, looks exactly the same and just has some gray hairs. He sees Poirot in the hotel and immediately acts worried which gives it away even more.

I remember this plot point being a big deal when I was reading the book and to have it almost spoiled so early felt kind of bad. How did everyone else feel about this when they saw the episode?

0,"Poirot audiobooks read by David Suchet and Hugh Fraser Hello fellow Poirot fans! As we approach the fall and continue the quarantine in many places around the world, I know I’m especially excited to revisit the David Suchet series. If you’re looking to get more Poirot but don’t necessarily have time to sit down and read or watch, I highly recommend the audiobooks read by David Suchet and Hugh Fraser. They both have amazing range as voice actors, and it’s so fun to hear Suchet reprise his role and go deeper into the source material. It’s also especially fun to hear Fraser do his good friend Poirot. Suchet’s performance of Death on the Nile is amazing, and my favorite from Fraser is Murder on the Links.

They’re all available on the subscription service Scribd, which is around $9 a month the last time I checked and a good value if you intend to listen to them all (find them by searching for the actors’ names, Scribd categorizes audiobooks by narrator in addition to author and title). They’re also available for standalone purchase from Audible, and I’d assume they’re also on public library platforms like Overdrive. Happy listening to you!","Hello fellow Poirot fans!

0,"Wondering about if I should read a book that I already saw the episode for? Hello!

Currently reading through all of the Poirot books in the order recommended on the Agatha Christie website. I also love to watch the show, but I mostly stick to the episodes that are based on the short stories. I tried watching the episodes for the novels I had finished but got frustrated that so many changes were made in the narrative and the order and the characters (I know it's not a big deal, I was just a little let down).

Anyways, I accidentally watched ""Peril at End House"" without figuring out that it was a novel I had yet to come to. Then when I started to read I was like oh heck I already know how this one ends. 

So my question is, should I bother reading it or just move on? I already read one beyond (just finished ""Lord Edgewater Dies,"" loved it) but now that I'm at the next book I'm really hesitating..... I'm kind of anal about things like going in order.... So between that and already knowing the ending, I'm at a crossroads and don't know if the book is different enough from the episode or good enough to read.","Hello!

0,"Just finished ""Murder on the Links"", I don't know if I'm getting better at figuring things out, or if I'm exactly where Christie wants me to be. (Spoilers) So, I planned to take a bit longer on this one, enjoy it slowly. But That only lasted the first couple chapters. By the time I was about 1/3rd through, I didn't want to stop.

I felt the most clever I've felt so far reading this one. I was able to guess at a lot of things before they came to light. I figured out the message in the victim's pocket being for Jack (I'm using victim because three people with the same surname and the victim having two names). I figured that the situation wasn't an affair but blackmail and pieced together victim's true identity almost immediately after that past was introduced, and so the reason for the blackmail fell into place. 

I guessed that the illusive sister was the one with a connection to Jack immediately as well. I couldn't think of another reason to introduce a sister and never have her around, narratively, other than for that reveal or the subversion of that idea. I didn't think Christie would be so obvious as to do double-switcheroo at that point. 

 I felt like I had a handle on everything this time... right up until the actual murderer was revealed, and once again, I felt dumb, because of course there was a third level to that backstory and I stopped at level two and patted myself on the back for seeing through Christie's red herring, only for it to flip around and the red herring be the solution. 

I also suspected the faked death thing due to how obvious the setup is at the start, but I was really waiting for some miraculous reveal that the victim had somehow pulled it off like he had some twin or something crazy like that (Silly I know, but wouldn't surprise me).

So yeah, I don't know if I was more clever this time, or if Christie just lead me by the nose right up until the reveal. 

Some other thoughts not about the main whodunit aspect: I was not expecting Hastings to meet his wife in the second published novel. I knew from osmosis that he gets married at some point, but I also thought his bad luck with women would be some kind of running gag given the way ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" ended. 

I also thought the part about Hastings being antagonistic to Poirot was really fascinating, because I haven't seen a perspective of Poirot from someone who views him as an adversary but doesn't belittle his talents yet. And I really enjoyed it because it drove home how absolutely terrifying it would be to have Poirot as an enemy. Sure, Poirot knew Hastings wasn't actually an enemy, and all would be revealed, to even have Hastings think Poirot was on the opposite side, and illustrate how weary he had to be of every move Poirot makes or doesn't make, was fascinating. 

Lastly,

I watched ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" episode. And have to say, it was so much better than ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" episode. It felt so much more faithful to the original telling, down to exact lines verbatim being spoken at points. Really felt like they cut no corners there. That said, I'm starting to realize that while Suchet does book Poirot wonderfully, series Hastings is a little too dry compared to his book counterpart. While book Hastings is dull compared to Poirot, it's very clearly just because Poirot is brilliant. Hastings puts things together and can be witty and is actually quite good at reading people and their reactions, even if he doesn't connect the dots for all the reasons behind them. He's not a dullard. The show however, makes Hastings about as clever as a slice of white bread, and about as entertaining. He doesn't do much but serve as the character Poirot has to spell everything out for. I get why he's like that, just feel it's a bit of a shame that his book version is so much more of a person.

Next up is ""Murder Under the Sun"", then ""Elephants Can Remember"" or ""Five Little Pigs"".","So, I planned to take a bit longer on this one, enjoy it slowly. But That only lasted the first couple chapters. By the time I was about 1/3rd through, I didn't want to stop.

I felt the most clever I've felt so far reading this one. I was able to guess at a lot of things before they came to light. I figured out the message in the victim's pocket being for Jack (I'm using victim because three people with the same surname and the victim having two names). I figured that the situation wasn't an affair but blackmail and pieced together victim's true identity almost immediately after that past was introduced, and so the reason for the blackmail fell into place. 

I guessed that the illusive sister was the one with a connection to Jack immediately as well. I couldn't think of another reason to introduce a sister and never have her around, narratively, other than for that reveal or the subversion of that idea. I didn't think Christie would be so obvious as to do double-switcheroo at that point. 

 I felt like I had a handle on everything this time... right up until the actual murderer was revealed, and once again, I felt dumb, because of course there was a third level to that backstory and I stopped at level two and patted myself on the back for seeing through Christie's red herring, only for it to flip around and the red herring be the solution. 

I also suspected the faked death thing due to how obvious the setup is at the start, but I was really waiting for some miraculous reveal that the victim had somehow pulled it off like he had some twin or something crazy like that (Silly I know, but wouldn't surprise me).

So yeah, I don't know if I was more clever this time, or if Christie just lead me by the nose right up until the reveal. 

Some other thoughts not about the main whodunit aspect: I was not expecting Hastings to meet his wife in the second published novel. I knew from osmosis that he gets married at some point, but I also thought his bad luck with women would be some kind of running gag given the way ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" ended. 

I also thought the part about Hastings being antagonistic to Poirot was really fascinating, because I haven't seen a perspective of Poirot from someone who views him as an adversary but doesn't belittle his talents yet. And I really enjoyed it because it drove home how absolutely terrifying it would be to have Poirot as an enemy. Sure, Poirot knew Hastings wasn't actually an enemy, and all would be revealed, to even have Hastings think Poirot was on the opposite side, and illustrate how weary he had to be of every move Poirot makes or doesn't make, was fascinating. 

Lastly,

I watched ""The Mysterious Affair at Styles"" episode. And have to say, it was so much better than ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"" episode. It felt so much more faithful to the original telling, down to exact lines verbatim being spoken at points. Really felt like they cut no corners there. That said, I'm starting to realize that while Suchet does book Poirot wonderfully, series Hastings is a little too dry compared to his book counterpart. While book Hastings is dull compared to Poirot, it's very clearly just because Poirot is brilliant. Hastings puts things together and can be witty and is actually quite good at reading people and their reactions, even if he doesn't connect the dots for all the reasons behind them. He's not a dullard. The show however, makes Hastings about as clever as a slice of white bread, and about as entertaining. He doesn't do much but serve as the character Poirot has to spell everything out for. I get why he's like that, just feel it's a bit of a shame that his book version is so much more of a person.

&gt;Murder on the Orient Express

&gt;Death on the Nile

&gt;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd

&gt;The A.B.C. Murders

&gt;The Mysterious Affair at Styles


...this past week. Not that I'm enjoying them any less, but rather the opposite, I've basically put a bunch of other stuff on hold this last week flying through these.

As to 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles', she got me again. I played right into her hands. From early on I suspected John, and then he got arrested and I felt like a genius, and then realized I still had about 25% of the story to go, and felt a fool. I was sure it wasn't Lawrence relatively early, even when the fingerprints came up, I was convinced Christie was doing that thing she loves to do where she draws your attention to two people but then only digs into one hoping you'll ignore or forget about the other. And the coffee cup thing I didn't know exactly what the reason was, but I did suspect rightly that their drawing attention to his terror-struck face, his medical background, and the hints that he and Cynthia got along surprisingly well when alone (and that Hastings naively dropped the line about seeing how he could be love-able when one got to know him), and put together that A. his secret was going to be that he loved Cynthia, and B. he suspected someone else of doing something (The terror-struck face not directed at his mother but something else in the room felt way too on the nose for Christie, basically ruled him out because he was to suspicious right away... ironically). 

All this being too suspicious however, also led me to play right into Christie's hands with Alfred. I thought his wife calling his name was a clear red herring. So by the time Poirot read the letter I was fooled completely. 

I also thought about Cynthia and the bromides, but I never suspected she'd poison them. Would be too obvious, both in-universe and as a reader. Briefly considered that she could have pretended to be Alfred to source the poison in a way that couldn't be traced back to her. But again, she has ample access to her own poisons, and nobody would suspect her prints or anything when she clearly works with said poison regularly. It occurred to me there was still the incentive to frame Alfred, but to that point, I started thinking, this is a very sloppy way to frame someone, she would have no way of ensuring he had an alibi. 

Which brings me to the framing of Albert, which honestly, looking back on it, if the story had ended any other way, would have bothered me in the same sloppiness that got him temporarily exonerated. Everything else was too cleverly concealed. 

I did not put together the tampering with the bell being of the same night Emily skipped her medicine, which should have been a very obvious clue as to the poison being her medicine in retrospect, but I was too hung up on characters to consider it. Like, at that point I figured it'd give clue as to the methods of the killer, but I didn't think it'd reveal the killer, so I put the bell to the back of my mind.

I never suspected the Doctor for the same reason Poirot rules him out, couldn't think of a motive. Considered Mary but in a way, there was too much leading that direction, and again, I thought her secret was going to be an affair, but then when she had that talk of running away, her motive seemed less plausible, and it would have been a surprise for someone like Christie to write a character so inconsistent. She was too real with Hastings, and someone whose response to an oppressive atmosphere is flight instead of fight... It could have been her, but that would have annoyed me very much if were. Too much of an act for someone she didn't have to convince of anything.

So I guessed quite a bit right, but ultimately got it wrong, and completely believed Evelyn to be genuine in her hatred of Alfred. But again, thought it was going to come up as another red herring (I actually suspected that it would be revealed her hatred was genuine, but for a different reason, that they weren't cousins, but were actually at one point married or something, explaining the shared last name, and her hatred).

---
Overall thoughts, I wasn't sure what to expect, knowing this was the first in the series. I thought maybe the ending would be a bit more straight forward, and was happily and handily fooled. I also knew Poirot was a Belgian living in England, but it never occurred to me he was a war refuge. Different times and all, but I guess I figured he would be relatively poor in that case, and since in every other case I've read he was retired and seemed not wanting for money, I assumed he had just relocated in retirement, the setting being war-time not holding much significance to his character itself. I am considering taking notes next time instead of trying to keep everything in my head, but the problem there is that Christie adds so little superfluousness, so many red herrings, and hides so many clues in plain sight, that the notes surrounding the case would rival the length of the publications themselves. I may at least jot down facts of the crime itself as keeping track of those details seems to be weaker than my ability to tease apart character relationships and motivations. 

Next up is probably going to either be 'The Murder on the Links' or ""Elephants Can Remember"", the former by order of rating and release, the latter being recommended. I also don't understand how GoodReads ranking system works, as I thought I had a list ordered by ranking but the average ranking on some of them are higher than the ones above them, with similar number of readers having ranked them.","So, think I'm going to slow down a bit, having now read:

0,"This sub doesn't have much going on, so as a new fan, I'm going to keep posting my opinions as I finish stories. Just finished ""The A.B.C. Murders"" Well, unlike with ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"", I avoided any information on this one. I just decided on it next by sorting by rating on goodreads. So I knew nothing else about it. I don't even know if it's held in that high regard, as I noticed the rating was high, but the number of ratings was significantly lower than a lot of others (something like 90k vs 250k). 

I didn't figure this one out before the ending like previously. I did consider that someone was manipulating Cust, but Christie suckered me right along with Poirot's ""It could have been a woman"", and the phone call to Cust. I didn't however suspect it would be as simple as the two women it seemed most likely to be (Thora or Lily (though Lily being given so little time in the spotlight, I thought maybe an accomplice, which was dashed instantly when Hastings suggested it, because then I was sure Christie was basically poking fun at readers who fell for it.)) I also doubted whether there was another. The setup seemed a bit more outlandish than the more intimate murders of the other works I've finished, and I'm not sure all the talk of luck really justified just how impossible the setup seemed, regardless of how much sense it made when everything came together. So when we got Cust's POV after the botched D murder, I then thought for a short bit that maybe Christie was trying something different and instead of a whodunit she was going more for the mystery being how he'd be caught and why, but it didn't seem right. There were too many hints that hadn't come together by the time they started chasing Cust.

I also did suspect Clarke for a second, when Cust mentioned a salary, and something in the back of my head (maybe my own little gray cells), said ""Even with suggestion, how would the culprit finance all the travel and the setup? Fraser couldn't afford to take Betty out more than twice a week, and nobody else is that well off. Thora may have gotten gifts from Car Clarke, but not dead Clarke is the only person we've really seen a lot of with money to burn. Still, I have to admit that unlike with Sheppard, I wasn't pointing the finger at him at the end. 

Nope, this time I got got. I didn't have a proper answer and just decided to read on and see what happens. The only reason I really knew it wasn't just Cust being that given how out of it he seemed when we got his perspective, I didn't see him being of mind to write such taunting letters. 

I'm not sure how I feel about ""The A.B.C. Murders"", it was very entertaining, and it got me, but it was such a departure from the last three, that when Poirot started listing clues found pointing to Clarke, I thought ""In another version of this story, that could have been a novel in and of itself"". It was different, and much more... heady? maybe not the word. It felt much more modern in it's scope than the traditional whodunit. (Of course, lots of things still antiquated, I found the idea of ""People don't kill strangers without reason"" somewhat funny, imagining Poirot trying to logic out the madness of some later serial killers, but one has to take account of the schools of thought prevalent at the time of writing). 

All said and done, I didn't enjoy it as much as Ackroyd or Death on the Nile due to the absurdness of the complexity of the scheme, but I still enjoyed it very much, and can see why it's well regarded. 

Next up is either the start or the end: The Mysterious Affair at Styles, or Curtain. The Mysterious Affair at Styles is the next on the list as far as order by rating, but I have to admit, I find myself wanting to read Curtain, just because I've become somewhat attached to Poirot's character more than the mysteries, and want to see how Agatha Christie in her dislike of him by that point, decided to send him off. Would it be a bad idea to read Curtain next? Does it spoil any earlier works?

Or, is there a better reading order here? I don't know if order of publication is also chronological order, and I'm afraid to look stuff up for fear of being spoiled. I don't usually care for reading things in order of release.

0,"Just finished ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"", wanted to post my thoughts and vent a bit (Huge Spoilers) So, I loved it, but it was ruined for me by how many articles list it as the best Poirot story. Whether it is or not, I haven't read enough to know (I've only previously finished Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile). 

See, the problem is the way it's talked about. Articles kept mentioning how it's got such a shocking twist, and that nobody could possibly guess the murderer... so of course I thought to myself, well when a whodunnit is all about figuring out who the unexpected murderer is, then who is the most unexpected? And immediately it stuck out that unlike Death on the Nile, which I had just finished a day before starting The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, this one was first person.

So I had those alarm bells, and am also very much a believer of the mentality ""A good writer doesn't point out things that aren't important"". Sure, red herrings and all that, but bringing up the dictaphone, then Sheppard's hobby of tinkering with gadgets, both had me thinking about them most the novel. Then the second they reveal Ralph I was like ""Unreliable narrator, it was Sheppard, done."" (I even remember much earlier being like, why does nobody suspect the doctor after the reveal that the niece never saw Roger? Even if we're supposed to trust him, the police have no reason not to suspect he could have sneaked back in somehow, but I chalked it up to maybe it being a societal thing, doctors being held in higher regard than others kind of thing). 

What bugs me though, is that I wouldn't have figured it out if top lists didn't have this ""You'll never guess"" mentality about it. Kind of reverse psychology'd myself into it, which has left me kind of unsatisfied with figuring it out. Feel like I figured it out using supplemental clues.

Edit: Also just watched the episode afterwards, and though I enjoy the show and Suchet's performance, really feel like they butchered what makes the book so clever by not telling it from the perspective of Sheppard proper, having Poirot be less buddy-buddy with him, and tacking on an ending that makes him feel much more like a more conventional cartoonish villain. That they replace him in so many scenes with Japp also made him feel much more plausible a suspect throughout that everyone seems to trust for no reason. And lastly, though I understand that often they have to combine characters and omit things for brevity, but combining two characters with such vastly different personalities as Raymond and Blunt, and giving that character some of Parker's roles in the story, while making Parker also less shifty, it just felt like a lot of the best parts of the plot were omitted/cut.","So, I loved it, but it was ruined for me by how many articles list it as the best Poirot story. Whether it is or not, I haven't read enough to know (I've only previously finished Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile). 

See, the problem is the way it's talked about. Articles kept mentioning how it's got such a shocking twist, and that nobody could possibly guess the murderer... so of course I thought to myself, well when a whodunnit is all about figuring out who the unexpected murderer is, then who is the most unexpected? And immediately it stuck out that unlike Death on the Nile, which I had just finished a day before starting The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, this one was first person.

So I had those alarm bells, and am also very much a believer of the mentality ""A good writer doesn't point out things that aren't important"". Sure, red herrings and all that, but bringing up the dictaphone, then Sheppard's hobby of tinkering with gadgets, both had me thinking about them most the novel. Then the second they reveal Ralph I was like ""Unreliable narrator, it was Sheppard, done."" (I even remember much earlier being like, why does nobody suspect the doctor after the reveal that the niece never saw Roger? Even if we're supposed to trust him, the police have no reason not to suspect he could have sneaked back in somehow, but I chalked it up to maybe it being a societal thing, doctors being held in higher regard than others kind of thing). 

What bugs me though, is that I wouldn't have figured it out if top lists didn't have this ""You'll never guess"" mentality about it. Kind of reverse psychology'd myself into it, which has left me kind of unsatisfied with figuring it out. Feel like I figured it out using supplemental clues.

Are we to assume that Etienne de Sousa was just a patsy-of-opportunity?  It seemed clear that the villains didn't know exactly when he'd arrive until he showed up.  What if he hadn't shown up until the next day?  Did they have a backup patsy and plan?

Are we to believe that Merdell was the only person in the neighborhood of Nasse House who recognized Sir George's true identity?

How much time passed between Marlene Tucker's first blackmail attempt against Sir George and her getting whacked?  It seems like it must have been long enough to pull together the plans for the garden fete to use as the cover for the murder and to pull together the plans for faux-Hattie to disappear.  How plausible is it that Sir George had full confidence that Marlene would keep her mouth shut, payoff or no payoff, until he could get her whacked?  Also, he obviously figured out that Marlene was getting her information from Merdell.  How would he have had confidence that Merdell wouldn't have told anyone else?  It seems like a better plan would have been to grab up Marlene, stash her somewhere on the property, arrange for a note to be delivered to Merdell before anyone realized Marlene was missing demanding that he show up somewhere if he ever wanted to see her again, rough him up when he showed up to verify that he hadn't blabbed to anyone else, whack both of them, put the bodies in the boat house, drive to London with faux-Hattie, and be off to the continent before anyone even realized that Merdell and Marlene were missing.","I just watched *Dead Man's Folly*, and, never having read the novel, am confused about a couple of plot points:

0,"Chateau Neuf du Pape, season 10, and not better for it. Wow. At 10 I summered in Hong Kong. I loathed the Country Club where my mother and her family spent each day acting like they were acting  in a BBC version of “The Americans.” 

I found solace exploring Victoria Peak where we stayed, about half way to the top, and the vibrant, imagination candy of the downtown “Central” district. Kowloon, via Star Ferry, or Macau by hydrophilic boat all close at hand.

I began reading Poirot novels that summer. Sitting on the edge of some back alley stairs that led to yet another back alley and taking Dim Sum w my uncles driver, Tony, who I thought was Bruce Lee. My uncle Charlie was Far East CEO of, at the time, AIU, now AIG.

I loved Hercule and Hastings and the notion of Christies that the chickens of Empire would come home to roost. Her characters were mostly appalling classists suspicious of any foreigner. I was young but a reader, so I knew her books written in the early and mid 30’s were filled w Mosley style, fascist Brits and Americans who were clearly pro-German. The way she used the Great War to remind us of wars reality was spot on. I loved the Poirot books until the final few. By 9th grade, I had moved on to Chandler, Innes, Ross M., etc.

I had never watched the TV show until quite recently. While I enjoyed season one and two, despite the overdoing of la motif de camp, and allowed myself a guilty pleasure. After all, they were made before the TV evolution around le fin fe siecle. Before the the Sopranos, Lost, BB, The Wire and Shield, Madmen, Line of Duty, Spooks et al. 

Then, my Amazon prime account forced a jump from the end of season 3 all the way to season 9. 

Jesus fucking Christ old bean, what great things had happened!!! Every thing from Art direction, locations, the suddenly excellent writing and as Hercule might say, “ the running of the show..,”
all of it. 

As if they looked at “Midsomer” and the success of other exceeding smart shows like “Sherlock,” and “The Worriker Trilogy” and jumped on board. Usually the best work is done in the first 6 or so series. So too I thought that it would be avec Poirot.

Imagine my surprise when I was blown away by seasons 10-12, where I sit and poke this into my phone like a thirsty crackhead. I felt compelled to say that while the early seasons are good, so far the dozen or so episodes Ive watched have been like a different, better rendering of life among the pre WWII rural haute bourgeoisie than almost anything I’ve watched.

Great job all! Thank you. So dark, each installment is, that “the finding of the torch” shines its light on many truths long kept in the potting shed. Not just on “whodunnit.”

I have a just turned 18 year old bairn, I cannot imagine allowing him to roam the streets of HK, 1976, alone with pickets stuffed with Wan. I mean, if I could find a pay phone and call Tony, all of Fu Manchu’s triad would certainly have scattered to the docks and the boat people I was told never to make eye contact with. Of course I did, met a family who lived on a wee unmapped Island, the father Kwon had webbed feet, and I would take their wee son, about seven or so to the movies, Tiger Balm Gardens, etc. I remembered crying on the DC 10 when we headed off for a week in Bangkok before returning home to NYC. Thank God I had Hercule and a mother who knew I could handle myself.

So far I've watched and loved: Peril at End House (my favorite) and The Cypress. Hallowe'en Party was okay... And now I'm watching Three Act Tragedy which I love but is also a bit confusing because of the whole war, MI6, navy thing. Anything political confuses me because I'm not British or European so it's less interesting.

I've watched the movies: Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile (my favorite), Appointment with Death, Evil Under the Sun and Thirteen at Dinner. I know they're not Suchet's so I'll rewatch their episodes last.

What other episodes do you recommend that are your favorite and I would like?

I won't get into details to not be too spoiler-y, but basically both novels have the same ethical dilemma : Poirot investigates the murder a terrible human being. Terrible, but still human, so Poirot can't let that slide, even if everyone around him tells him that he should...  
In Murder on the Orient Express, he eventually decides to keep the true culprit's indentity a secret, just this time. And, of course, he promises to not tell anyone : it would both condemn the people he chose to save, but also ruin his own reputation.

BUT in Appointment with Death, one the suspects clearly tells Poirot that he can let go of this murder case, since he's done it before, during the Orient Express incident. Of course Poirot doesn't confirm that he did what he's accused of, but, still, how the hell does this person know about his biggest secret ?  
Basically, who spilled the bean ?!

It's clearly established in the Poirot stories that the books themselves do exist in this universe. Or, at least, some of them... Is it the same for Murder on the Orient Express ? If so, how much do the public actually know ? Why doesn't it have more consequences on Poirot's reputation ?

But I can't find any references ! Even my belgian friends have no idea, and google didn't really help me.

The uniform he wears in the Poirot TV series episode *The Chocolate Box*, I have no idea where they get it from. Maybe it is accurate, maybe it isn't. It vaguely looks like a french army uniform from that period, or a british police uniform... So I'm lost.

0,"The 2010 television adaptation of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" was surprisingly dark and gritty *Spoilers*


I was a teenager when David Suchet's 2010 version of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" came out. I remember it being quite... unsettling, even disturbing (even though I had watched many horror movies and the like by that point), and also quite different from the book and the 1974 movie (and, now, the 2017 movie). After rewatching the 2010 adaptation years later, I still feel the same way. I'm going to explain why.


To start with, the first 15 minutes, before Poirot even sets foot on the Orient Express, feature two gritty and pretty disturbing scenes, neither of which are in the book or any other adaptations. First, we have Poirot interrogating British Army officer in Palestine, accused of murder. Poirot catches the man in a lie and confronts him about it. Realizing that the game is up, the officer pulls out a gun and commits suicide right in front of Poirot. Later, we see Poirot in Istanbul, where he witnesses a woman (accused of adultery) being stoned to death. Both of those scenes are tense, painfully prolonged and, yes, quite bloody, and they clearly leave a strong impression on Poirot. In retrospect, it feels like those scenes are possibly meant to make the viewer question vigilantism even before the actual murder mystery starts; or maybe even make the viewers reject the vigilantism from the start. It could also serve as sort of a justification for Poirot's harsh attitude toward the revenge-driven murderers later on.


The way Ratchett/Casetti is portrayed in the 2010 adaptation is a bit different as well. In the book, as well as the 1974 movie, Ratchett is portrayed mainly as a smug jerk, who, at most, seems annoyed when Poirot refuses to provide him protection. In the 2010 adaptation, Ratchett is clearly in fear of his life and he appears terrified when Poirot turns down his offer. Which is, after all, exactly what the murderers wanted to accomplish by sending him threatening letters before killing him.


The way Rachett's death plays out is also quite creepy. It is only briefly shown in a flashback, but it is obvious that, although drugged, Ratchett is not completely unconscious. He is aware of what is happening to him, and he feels the pain, but he doesn't have enough strength nor presence of mind to move or scream.Thought that was evident the moment his body was found: his lifeless eyes were wide opened and filled with terror.
There is one other disturbing element to the 2010 adaptation: the temperatures are so low that the passengers come close to freezing to death.


After the 15-minute intro, the episode takes place almost entirely inside the train, giving it a strong claustrophobic feel; which is supposed to be a part of the charm, since it is a murder mystery on a train, but it feels especially uncomfortable and unnerving in this adaptation, all things considered. Same with the crime (child abduction and murder) that Ratchett/Casetti was guilty off; it is true to the original, but it comes off as especially disturbing in this adaptation, when everything else about it is considered.


Poirot's reaction and attitude are also quite different, and dark. When Poirot solves the case, he is disgusted by the murderers, feeling that they held themselves above the law, and perverted justice for the sake of revenge. The episode also explores Poirot's Catholicism, even though that wasn't really explored in the books or the previous episodes. Bouc, more sympathetic toward the vigilantes, suggests making up a story about a lone perpetrator who sneaked on the train, and presenting that conclusion to the Yugoslav police, but Poirot repeatedly refuses to go along with that. Witnessing Poirot's resolve, one of the murderers, colonel Arbuthnot, actually tries to kill Poirot and Bouc, saying: ""We have assigned one murder to the [made-up, kimono-wearing] assassin, we can assign two more."" However, his co-conspirators stop him. 


This is the scene in question, and probably one of the most difficult scenes to watch:

https://youtube.com/watch?v=JQRVJF4u-GE


In the end, Poirot does present the ""first theory"" to the Yugoslav police (an unknown perpetrator sneaked on the train, killed Ratchett and managed to flee before the train derailed), thus letting the real killers off, but there is clearly no relief, content or sense of justice for anyone involved, especially Poirot. Heck, by the end, it is difficult to fathom Poirot letting those people go. But he does. The final scene shows Poirot crying and clutching a  rosemary as he walks away from the train.


Some fans liked the different, gritty adaptation of ""Murder on the Orient Express"". Many didn't; heck, many outright hated it. As for me, though I felt that the mystery/investigation element worked quite well, David Suchet's acting was great like usual, and the claustrophobic feeling/atmosphere throughout the episode was spot-on, I honestly didn't enjoy that adaptation of ""Murder on the Orient Express"". I found it to be way too gritty and depressing, and actually uncomfortable/hard to watch at times, as well as too far removed from the original, mainy in terms of tone and atmosphere, for the aforementioned reasons.

At the beginning of the story, Poirot is first alerted to the plot to kill Nick by finding a bullet hole in Nick's hat, and then finds a bullet on the ground, confirming his suspicions.

Who fired the bullet?

Hello all, wanted to contribute an interesting quirk I've noticed that doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.

Long story short, it seems that Hergé drew a cameo/referenced Agatha Christie's [Hercule Poirot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot) within one of his less famous books. It's not Tintin per se, but within the side series of [Jo, Zette and Jocko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Jo,_Zette_and_Jocko#The_Valley_of_the_Cobras). I couldn't find subs for that series though, so I'm posting it here under the general 'Herge' umbrella.

In the book [Valley of the Cobras](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ABz-D4fCx367j-A&amp;cid=829A85CF8BE28660&amp;id=829A85CF8BE28660%21385&amp;parId=829A85CF8BE28660%21334&amp;o=OneUp), the Maharajah of Gopal has need of a detective to track down a misplaced pearl necklace. And on [page 4](http://imgur.com/D7ThrBf), a familiar portly man with with an [egg-shaped head and a magnificent mustache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot#Appearance_and_proclivities) going by the name of ['Hercule Goodspy'](http://imgur.com/JNviY5m), appears. 

Aside from the similarities in the first name, appearances and vocation, there's good reason to believe that this character isn't simply a random detective. The same page shows the Maharajah referring to an obvious caricature of [Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes) complete with his trademark pipe and deerstalker hat. A later page has an example of how Sherlock was portrayed as a [detective pursuing physical clues,](http://imgur.com/5Z4sqTN) which itself was [markedly different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot#Methods) from [Poirot's psychological approach.](http://www.manybooks4u.net/book2/Murder_on_the_Links/index_5.html)

Furthermore, Valley of the Cobras was published in 1956, which would have been several years after Agatha's Poirot [became hugely popular.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot_in_literature) That Poirot was a Belgian detective and Hergé himself was a Belgian [writing a Franco-Belgian comic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Jo,_Zette_and_Jocko#The_Valley_of_the_Cobras) might not have factored into his decision to include a cameo of Poirot into one of his books, but it seems overwhelmingly likely that this physically similar character is indeed a reference to Poirot (in the same way there's a later reference to Sherlock).

My take? Hergé might have found it amusing to include an iconic character that older readers (who might've read Agatha) would know of. Children may have recognized the Sherlock reference, but it seems too coincidental that this character was included in a book when just when Poirot was becoming more popular (or already was). And so Poirot got a brief cameo in another literary world :)

Thoughts?

1,"The Copper Beeches - Mrs. Violet Hunter When people talk about women in the Sherlock Holmes cases there always seems to be fixation on Irene Adler and while her somewhat outsmarting Sherlock is notable I have to say that Mrs. Violet Hunter left a more lasting impression on me. 

She's educated (speaking English, some German and some French, music and drawing), has great intuition, she ends up as a teacher, she's not involved with any men romantically, she's an orphan, she's a great observer and Sherlock compares her to the actions he would advise for if he had a sister. 
For me she paints a really progressive picture of what women could be and have been at the time. 

She isn't looked on as a woman that has shady motives, is greedy or completely devoted to a man, she's not in a role of motherhood and she isn't having an affair.  

She shows one model of so women that contrast to many other in the book. Her marriage free, child free, educationally interested and educated, unbound and clever character is really unique.","When people talk about women in the Sherlock Holmes cases there always seems to be fixation on Irene Adler and while her somewhat outsmarting Sherlock is notable I have to say that Mrs. Violet Hunter left a more lasting impression on me.

1,"My thoughts on 'The Man With The Twisted Lip' *The Man With The Twisted Lip* is an unusual Holmes story. Rather than investigating a murder or robbery, this time there may not even have been a crime committed.

The story begins when a Mrs St Clair engages Sherlock Holmes to find her husband, a wealthy city worker who’s gone missing. She last saw him at the window of an opium den, where he seemed to be dragged backwards. After rushing up to find him, she burst into the room to find no-one but a disfigured beggar. On finding her husband’s clothes in the room, the police arrested the beggar but have since found no clues to Mr St Clair’s whereabouts. 

A few days later, Mrs St Clair receives a letter from her husband assuring her that he is fine and well – forcing Holmes to rethink the direction of his investigation. 

*The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes* collects some of the most memorable, colourful and surprising of the Holmes stories. Whether this is due to Conan Doyle’s fresher writing in the early days or simply because when I re-read my collection these come first, it’s too early to say. This is one, of a good number, that I can recall the entire mystery from the title alone.

As with all the Holmes stories, *The Man With The Twisted Lip* has been adapted many times over the years for tv and radio. Most directly, it was part of the 1980s Granada Jeremy Brett series, but also featured in *Sherlock Holmes in the 22nd* *Century* and the opening scene was used as part of the *Sherlock* episode *His Last Vow*.

Spoilers if you dig deeper into this next bit of trivia, but the story may have been inspired by the work of [Arthur Pember](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Pember#Journalist). Pember wrote a series of articles for the *New York Times* in the 1870s, disguising himself as a range of identities, including as a beggar and circus performer, to research his articles. 

&amp;#x200B;

One other small point of note, it’s in *The Man With The Twisted Lip* that Mary Watson refers to her husband as “James” rather than John. Some have theorised she’s using the English version of hi middle name “Hamish” but this was never confirmed by Conan Doyle.

Every time I read this story I enjoy it, despite knowing exactly what’s about to happen. [Conan Doyle ranked the story as his 16th favourite from the series](https://strandmag.com/top-ten-sherlock-holmes-stories/), one of many he chose from his first collection *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*, and it’s hard to disagree.","*The Man With The Twisted Lip* is an unusual Holmes story.

1,"How would it change things in Watson was Afghani? I just had a thought, and wanted to run it past you--

In the original stories, Watson was an injured English veteran of the Second Afghan War, who was (at least initially) trying to get his life in order after returning home. How do you think it would change things if he wasn't an Afghan vet, but an Afghan himself? Perhaps he was a native combat medic / translator who came back with the troops? 

I could see some interesting scenarios for fanfiction here: perhaps Holmes refuses to enter a hookah lounge or other ""unrefined"" location, so Watson does it instead. Or perhaps he speaks to a fellow Afghan imformant while Holmes is distracted somewhere. 

The way I'm envisioning it, this could be an interesting way to bring some more diversity and equity to their relationship--i.e., Holmes *can't* come up with all these answers, but Watson can finally contribute. 

Unfortunately, though I'd be interested in turning this into a full story, I'm not sure I can; I don't know enough about Anglo-Afghan relations, Afghani culture, etc. etc. etc. But I could definitely keep it on the back burner!","I just had a thought, and wanted to run it past you--

He is nothing like the one sir A.C.D. books and that hurts a bit. He was portrayed as one of the  stupid, money hungry, sexist, social, one to easily curse about a 16 year old and fit. All of these are not traits when I think of the original.
I do not dislike the idea of someone wanting to get Enola to be a fine lady and I very much found the scene on the carriage, where Enola had to hand over her money, very much heartbreaking and good for the plot... It just hurt that it came from Mycroft too

Sherlock.
First, in the movie he had blue eyes, when the original states that he has icy Grey ones. I think one wasn't very much able to see what kind of genius he has. Like when he looked at the flowers, it seemed a bit off. But when he explained where he had found the letters, it much more seemed like the Sherlock one expected. I know that the main focus should lay on Enola... But I just wished that they would have portrayed Mycroft as the smartest (perhaps more or less in secret or clouded by his lazy was), then Sherlock, then Enola with her rising up and gaining the other factors of being a good detective and becoming as good or better as Sherlock. I think they even showed that by Enola getting better with her disguises and fighting and in the scene where Sherlock came to Lestrade to report the crime, which she already did. I think they could have made that more obvious, that she didn't have all that it takes from the beginning.
But in the end, Sherlock was nice and I enjoyed him very much.

The mother.
Oi,  I think she is a bit of a mess, but that is also what she is supposed to resemble. In the books from sir A.C.D. Sherlock had described his past as rather normal. I think it was shortly before  Mycroft got introduced for the first time. It makes me wonder if the mother had given Mycroft and Sherlock similar lives while growing up. If yes, why are both so anti social/very introverted/very far away from family in the movies logic? Or was the affection only for Enola and then why?
In the End, I don't understand why she lead Enola on. Like with the cards and the ribbons and stuff. She wanted her to find the explosives on purpose, but why? Was she really mad? And if she was, then why wasn't Enola mad or worried about her in the end? She did abandon her. She was careless. I think she was pretending to be a good mother.
'Yes I will just head out now to possibly kill some people. I will not inform my 16 year old daughter, who is very much dependent on me. I want her to be fine when she is alone ((which is kind of disregarding her child's actual wants and needs)) that's why I make riddles for her and possibly leave her in the thought that im dead'.

Enola.
I think they tried her typical boyish. She was very much eager to be what her mother had taught her, but she still made mistakes along the way, which I very much liked. I don't like the weird relationship she had with the lord (who's name I can't remember, but I think it was Marcus). Like 'ye I hate you, you idiot, but I also kinda missed you'. All in all it was cheesy (and I love cheesy).
I feel like it's hard to get real character traits off of her and I'm not sure why. I think it's easier to get her over all feeling instead of her likes and Dislikes and so on. And her feeling is.. 'I'm smart and funny' and 'haha, fuck you all, I'm me bitch'.
Though I still very much enjoyed her. Seeing her transform and learn even still. Personally I didn't find the 4rth wall breaking annoying, but I rather took it as small treats to get a better inside. Though I would understand how people would find that and her character annoying.

The lord (Marcus I think).
I think he was more to portray typical girly character traits. He seemed nice and I enjoyed him very much also. Though I doubt that he was actually able to climb up that rope at his little tree house. I think that scene where Enola goes through the place was a bit confusing, but it also gave more depth to his character. He is 100% gay in my opinion XD. The romance between him and Enola is cute, but I couldn't really see it working out. Opposites attrack each other, but are you sure about that? XD
He is a cute boy. Fitted into the plot.


Things that especially bothered me:
Mycroft. Why did the mother lead Enola on to find her explosives? Why did Enola just decide that a random boy in danger deserves more attention than her mother endangering other lifes with bombs? Why are they trying to push the matter that Mycroft is more of a family guy than Sherlock? Is the mother really as good as Enola (and everyone else) thinks? 

Things that I especially liked:
That Enola was pushed down to her lowest, but she still got up. Her being send to that school was heartbreaking and it was even a bit unexpected or at least for me. Enola showing her line of reasoning with the viewer. The story with the small bits all coming together nicely.

. 

I think this can go onto my list of favorite movies especially when they will make a sequel or if I decide to read the books of which it was actually based off of.

.

If you came this far.... Respekt. Have this cookie🍪","Frist, I only just watched the movie and I will compare it to the original books from sir Author Conan Doyle at times. I know the movie is based off of a different book series, which I haven't read however.

1,"Enola Holmes (Netflix 2020) non spoiler mini review. 6/10 

It's well acted lightly entertaining but not for fans of Sherlock Holmes IMO. There is no real mystery here, mostly predictable etc. But I have no huge issues beyond the changes to Sherlock and Mycroft. (Mycroft's observational powers are Nil. Sherlock's sociable, muscular and incredibly handsome now etc) 

Ultimately, this movie was not aimed at me. 

Is it worth a watch? Sure, on a dull afternoon when there's little else to do or if you have 12-18 year old kids who happen to be fans of Sherlock Holmes.","6/10

1,"Have I found myself caught up in some sort of Holmesian mystery? I'm reposting this from another subreddit because it took 5 hours to be approved, so it didn't really get any attention, and I would love to tease your brains and hear your thoughts on this silly situation of mine:

 

Earlier  this year, right as the pandemic was starting to heat up, I found  myself on the opposite coast of the US from my home state and needed to  purchase a car to get myself back across the country. I found an  affordable, used, newer-model vehicle at a dealership.

Today,  I received a strange hand-written letter from the dealership, along  with a business card. They explained that they had a customer who was  looking for the exact make, model, year, and color as my car, and they  were willing to offer me up to $2000 above the trade-in value to buy the  car back from me, if I still had it. There is nothing outwardly  interesting about this vehicle, that would explain why someone was so  intent about finding this exact model. In fact, with a carfax search I  found dozens of the exact same vehicle within a few hundred miles of  where I purchased it, at close to the same price I purchased it at.

I  puzzled over the letter for a minute. I could use the money more than I  could use the car right now, so it's an appealing offer. But my mind  quickly went to the wonderful Sherlock Holmes short story ""The Blue  Carbuncle,"" in which a Christmas goose with a stolen gemstone in its  stomach is accidentally sold to an unknowing customer, leading to the  thief's desperate efforts to track down the hapless buyer.

Is  there a bunch of drugs or cash or diamonds stashed in my car somewhere?  The person who sent this letter evidently knows the vehicle is  thousands of miles away from them, as they reached me at my home  address. What could explain their desire to reclaim this specific car,  from thousands of miles away, at the extra cost of transportation and a  much higher trade-in value?

Some other details that may or may not be relevant:

\-The  previous owner of the vehicle was a rental car company(in a state with a  reputation for higher-than-average criminal activity.)

\-The  letter has no return address written on it, although it does contain a  business card for and is signed by someone I personally dealt with at  the dealership

\-The dealership was  in full-on Covid-mode(skeleton crew,) when I made the purchase, so I  dealt with someone who was not actually a salesman but was instead the  financing guy, who was clearly not super familiar with the inventory.

\-Although  both cars were listed online, the car that I was originally interested  in was nowhere to be found on the lot, and no one knew where it was, so I  went for the one that that was the same year, make, almost the same  model, but a different color

\-There  seems to be a discrepancy between the actual color of the vehicle and  what is listed on the title. (neither matches the color of the other  vehicle I was looking to buy, at all) Have they made some huge  dealership fuckup that they are trying to quietly rectify?

\-Last  night between 1am and 6:30am three unlocked cars in my apartment  driveway were accessed and rifled though, which has never happened  before, not in the driveway, although this isn't a particularly good  neighborhood. My car was locked, or at least, had been locked by this  morning, and showed no sign of break-in.

Anyway,  I thought this was kind of a fun turn of events for me, and others might have insight or enjoy puzzling over it. I'm open to ideas on how  to safely take advantage of the situation for personal gain, since I'm  not particularly interested in fighting crime just for the sake of it,  as long as no one is getting hurt.","I'm reposting this from another subreddit because it took 5 hours to be approved, so it didn't really get any attention, and I would love to tease your brains and hear your thoughts on this silly situation of mine:

1,"My ""Jim Moriarty is alive"" Theory There's something that I cannot stop thinking about... So Moriarty worked with Eurus right? and he recorded the ""did you miss me?"" video... does that mean he anticipated his own death? when he shot himself on the roof? because why else would he record these videos if he didn't know he was going to die? 


Now listen I'll elaborate. In the fall episode, Jim's plan was to make Sherlock fall off the roof and basically die.. or thats what we're supposed to think. Because why would he record a video for Sherlock when Sherlock is supposed to be dead? unless it wasn't really what he wanted. He knew he was going to ""kill himself"".. but if thats true then what was his plan? 


Maybe Moriarty was planning for something bigger and needed to convince Sherlock that he's dead. Now he could've done it in a less dramatic way but maybe he thought that Sherlock wouldn't really believe that a mastermind with many guards and snipers walking around him would be easily killed, so he had to ""kill himself"" in front of Sherlock to make him believe so.


What happened to Jim's body? who retrieved it? we saw nothing about that. What happened to the snipers? 


1. maybe they took him home and he started hiding, just like Sherlock did after the fall. 


2. maybe he had some sort of deal with Mycroft and it wouldn't be the first time we see Mycroft needing Jim or making a deal with him. 


3. What if Mycroft put Jim in Sherrinford that maximum security prision island? the same way he convinced his parentes that Eurus was dead and put her in Sherrinford.","There's something that I cannot stop thinking about...

My great great great great (not sure how many greats) uncle was a man named Charles Mycroft. According to family stories passed down, he was a friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which as a family we like to think means that there's a pretty good chance that he was the namesake of Mycroft Holmes.

1,"My thoughts on The Red-Headed League *In which Holmes and Watson meet a fiery pawnbroker whose luck has run out.*

The Red-Headed League was [considered by Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle as the second-best of his Holmes stories](https://lithub.com/the-12-best-sherlock-holmes-stories-according-to-arthur-conan-doyle/) when reflecting on his output in 1927. It’s hard to disagree with the author, as this adventure, in particular, has remained in my memory since first reading it many years ago. 

That retention – not unusual for me as I tend to store details well – stands it ahead of all but one story in my mind too. Upon reading its title again, I at once knew the solution to the mystery and most of the details of the story.

Once of Conan-Doyle’s more ingenious plots, *The Red-Headed League* sees a poor pawnbroker approach Sherlock Holmes with an intriguing case. For two months he’s been paid by the titular league to sit in an office for four hours a day alone, copying out the encyclopaedia. Apparently selected for the job due to his fiery red hair, he found it an odd occupation but needed the money so went along with it.

One day, he turned up for work and found the office closed with a sign saying the League has been disbanded. Making some enquiries, the pawn broken learns that the office was rented under a false name and there is no record of the Red-Headed League ever existing.

Holmes believes he will have the case solved in a few days but warns the pawnbroker not to expect any further payment. Conferring with Watson, Sherlock reveals he suspects the truth runs much deeper than a peculiar prank played on an unsuspecting shopkeeper. 

To return briefly to Conan-Doyle’s list, it became the last known opinion of his creation from the author, who died around three years later. There’s little detail in his list, but he does note that this story, alongside *The Dancing Men*, wins a place for its “originality of plot”. I’ll speak for the latter in due course, but as for *The Red-Headed League,* I can’t think of a mystery with its unusual combination of the humdrum and fantastical. 

While the mystery is first-rate, its revelation requires some stage management by Conan-Doyle. Not unusual in his stories, but handled clumsily here, Holmes solves the case then proceeds to send Watson home while he makes arrangements. There is, of course, no reason for Sherlock to hold onto his knowledge other than to string the audience along. On this occasion though, it seems out of character for the theatrical detective to hold back information only to reveal it that evening. Usually, there is at least the mention of Holmes having to check a few facts before he is sure of himself.

Overall though, the story is more than enough to make up for this slight detour into contrivance. It’s original and unusual enough to linger long in the memory. Interestingly, in the 1985 Granada TV adaptation, the criminal in this case was revealed to be a student of Professor Moriarty. Had Conan-Doyle planned Holmes’ nemesis earlier, this would have made a wonderful addition to his web of villains working throughout the London underworld.","*In which Holmes and Watson meet a fiery pawnbroker whose luck has run out.*

1,"My Thoughts on A Scandal in Bohemia Though we often think of Sherlock Holmes as a character of short stories, it wasn’t until his third outing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle moved into the medium. The author would write a further 55 stories alongside 4 novels – beginning with *A Study in Scarlet* and *The Sign of Four*.

Other than the masterful *The Hound of the Baskervilles*, I have always preferred Holmes in shorter fiction. I find that reading through a single mystery before sleep is the perfect way to wrap a day – allowing the setup, deductions and resolution to clear my mind of the day.

It’s no surprise to me that in these odd times we live in, with the shops opening for the first time in three months today, vital anti-racism protests ongoing while racists are seemingly flushed from the gutter onto the streets of our cities, I have retreated into these stories again. They have given me comfort for two decades – allowing me to believe that right and wrong can be separated by good people, that right will win out and that intelligence can be directed to the most virtuous causes.  

It’s interesting then, that *A Scandal in Bohemia* fails in reassuring any of these concerns in the reader. The client, a European royal, has an indiscretion to cover up, Holmes does not succeed in his mission and the greater intelligence prevails in escaping with the evidence.

In the story, Holmes is tasked with recovering an embarrassing photograph of a Bohemian King who’s set to marry but is being blackmailed by his former lover Irene Adler. The detective must locate the evidence and secure it in just a few days or the marriage will end before it begins.

Conan Doyle doesn’t get the credit he deserves for the bold choices he makes, as most praise rightly falls on his iconic characters of Holmes, Watson, Lestrade, Moriarty and the perfectly rendered London they populate. Yet here, just like in *The Hound of the Baskervilles* where Watson takes centre stage, he does the unexpected.  In Holmes’ return to the page and debut short story, he fails.

He’s defeated – and only by a few hours, I must add – by Irene Adler. In later adaptions, Adler and Holmes are often pitched as would-be lovers but there’s not a hint of that here. His admiration for her is down to her cunning and wit, perhaps too her acceptance that while she bested Holmes for a moment, all she could do to escape him for good was leave the country. In keeping her photograph as payment, the great detective earns a reminder that he is not perfect and that there are parts of the human experience that he may never know.

Present for the first time in *A Scandal in Bohemia* is the artwork of Sidney Paget, whose depictions of Holmes in *The Strand* magazine are as influential as Conan Doyle’s writing. It’s from Paget’s hand that we get the iconic silhouette of Holmes, the devious face of Moriarty and their famous grapple above the Reichenbach Falls.

It’s a wonderful introduction to the type of Holmes story that made him the enduring character he became. Thanks to Conan Doyle’s brave choices and a story that raises the great detective’s profile as it pulls him down to Earth, *A Scandal in Bohemia* was the beginning of a magnificent literary legacy.","Though we often think of Sherlock Holmes as a character of short stories, it wasn’t until his third outing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle moved into the medium.

1,"Devil's Daughter Sucks Starting with awful UI design is very simple and not appropriate for the genre combination to graphics and cringy political propaganda that you would expect to see in every modern game, which makes you feel like developers consider you to be dumb and not notice it, and that you are paying your money to receive some propaganda, for your own money. This is like paying to get beaten in a dark alley. 19th century, you see a black woman, a rich black woman, in england. free. by her own, without a man. Ultra combo. This can almost be now considred a ""social science fiction"". I loved the crimes and punishments for how realistically the epoch and society was portrayed. Oh my... I am so tired of this modern trend of revisionism made by dumb ultra-leftist radicals and sponsors of marxism.

The graphics...Excessive auto-exposure in games never does good, and just in the first location, in sherlock's house auto exposure makes the scene brighter than needed. It doesn't feel like the game had any effort put in it, visual style is horrible.

The also changed Watson. Why? I hate when characters get replaced.

What I expect from a sequel is the same damn game but with new stories. I don't want that yellow design, this is a dark criminal investigations game, in a dark rainy london, not gta 5. I wander why, why they had to change everything that much. To show that they have done some work?  
Or because of dumb angry gamers that would call it a ""dlc"" because they didn't change the UI?  


The character even moves now not so quality. Damn, even controls suck. And the walking animation is cringy, the repetitivenes is very obvious, looks unnatural. And they literally should have just not ""fix"" what already works,  


The game has no soul now. It is not that dark london game. Sherlock is not a stylish english  gentleman, even watson has been changed to some kind of a jerk-like looking asshole","Starting with awful UI design is very simple and not appropriate for the genre combination to graphics and cringy political propaganda that you would expect to see in every modern game, which makes you feel like developers consider you to be dumb and not notice it, and that you are paying your money to receive some propaganda, for your own money.

1,"Elements that you expect in Sherlock Holmes adaptations Please correct me if I'm wrong as I haven't watch/read a lot of adaptation of Sherlock, but I figure this might be an interesting topic.

There are a lot of adaptations out there and each of them are trying to take the original spirit of Sherlock Holmes and put a new spin to it, such as they're taking Sherlock drug 'addiction' as one of his conflict in ""Elementary"" or making all of them female like Japanese's version ""Miss Sherlock"". But as far as I watch/read, most of them kept the Sherlock and Watson's original occupation and dynamic intact, even in modern setting.

This has me wondering, what elements do you expect to find in a Sherlock-themed adaptation? What are things that you wish Sherlock authors/creators' keep from the original Sherlock, because if it's changed, it would just ruin 'Sherlock'?

Oh, and if you guys have a recommendation of Sherlock adaptations that differs quite a lot from the original (i.e. Sherlock or Watson has different job or different personality), do comment below, I'm really interested to read/watch them all! Except for the Will Ferell movie because I have watched it and I think we all can agree it is one of the worst adaptation of Holmes.

Thank you in advance!","Please correct me if I'm wrong as I haven't watch/read a lot of adaptation of Sherlock, but I figure this might be an interesting topic.

I’ve never been on this sub before so I’m really sorry if I’m breaking etiquete here. I am looking for a version of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes audiobooks and am having trouble finding it. I have pretty severe panic attacks and I find that listening to this specific version of the audiobook helps to calm me down. Just about an hour ago I started having some panic attack symptoms and went to pull up my audiobook in iBooks and saw that it was gone. I recently got a new phone so I thought, “No big deal, I’ll just go download it again,” but it appears that the version I had is no longer in the Apple store. 

I did a bunch of internet research and still haven’t been able to find it and was hoping someone here could help (again, I’m sorry. I’m very desperate here) For context, the cover art for the audiobook is the Wikipedia page main photo here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes and the author has a very flat voice and doesn’t use a lot of inflection. He is of course British. Any help finding this would be greatly appreciated and would help me more than I can say. Thank you in advance!!","Hi all,

1,"Sherlock Joke Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson were going camping.  They pitched their tent under the stars and went to sleep.  Sometime in the middle of the night Holmes woke Watson up and said:

 “Watson, look up at the stars, and tell me what you see.”

Watson replied: “I see millions and millions of stars.”

1,"Intelligent Sherlock Holmes To mirror my last post, has there been a Sherlock Holmes adaptation that makes the audience feel stupid? 
In the books, the reader had the same intellect (maybe less) as Watson. So, when Holmes explained how he came to his conclusion, Watson (and maybe the reader) thought the solution was more obvious than what was configured without his help. 
Because of that fact, I am wondering if an adaptation stayed faithful to that regard and made the audience feel stupid after Holmes explains.

I might be slightly answering my own question, but RDJ played an action Holmes instead of detective; I don’t know what Basil Rathbone was doing, but he didn’t seem to be portraying Holmes, other than having the same name; I don’t know about Jeremy Brett; Benedict Cumberbatch seems the most robotic, so maybe him (although his adaptation does not think before speaking); and I am not sure of any other portrayal.","To mirror my last post, has there been a Sherlock Holmes adaptation that makes the audience feel stupid?

1,"Ranking the Sherlock Holmes Adaptations I hope that this idea has not been posed yet- if so, I would like the link- but, how would you rank the actors that played Sherlock Holmes?

Also, if you rank Benedict Cumberbatch in the top five or ten, don’t bother sending your list (I mean, I won’t hold it it against you if you do), I just really abhor is portrayal. Holmes was never an atheist, he was quite athletic, and he smoked HEAVILY, not wear some dag-nab-it (or da$&amp;) patches.

I have the handbook by Ransom Riggs which details some of the methods Holmes used, and some of the so-called methods it mentions are just outright laughably silly, such as when trying to lure a baddie out of his hidey-hole within a house, you are to ""walk away"" and proclaim loudly ""gee, it sure is a shame we could not find his hiding place. We'd better be off now. Good bye."" while others are actually useful, such as determining someone's height by foot size/stride, how to crack a combination lock code, some of the explanations of deduction, and using occam's razor, etc etc. Pretty good book, but not everything is actually practical. However, for the kid that I still am inside, it is a fun read.

1,"A beginners “basics”/guide to Sherlock Holmes? Hey guys!! So I’ve been suuuper interested in Sherlock Holmes for a while- it’s literally been on my mind all the time, searching everything about it, looking at pictures, etc, so I’m thinking about getting into it. I thought about watching the show, but I feel like I want to read the books first.             
I’ve done some research and to be honest,  I’m a little bit confused as to what to read first, how many there are, what is the difference between the short stories and the novel/volumes and many other things. Apparently theres movies too..? Ya, so I decided to come here and seek some help I guess.     
What are the basic things I should know if I’m only just a beginner? How would you recommend I read the books, and in what order?      
Also, would you recommend watching the show after reading it, or is it somewhat different than the actual plot? I really hope someone can help me! Thanks in advance! ","Hey guys!!

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter the last Seated at the table where, months ago, Sherlock and I had spoken of rational sentiment I found Miss Adler. The second cottage was complete and, with a new coat of paint on both, now bore no hint it was an afterthought. There were flowers on the table.

""Miss Adler, are you taking an afternoon of much deserved relaxation?""

""Mr. Holmes, I am enjoying the day and you should as well. We have all been quite busy and there is every indication the opportunities to escape from our rigors will increasingly be more difficult to capture, at least in the near future.

""I have been mentally walking through one of my favorite mazes. As you know, our newest recruit, Wilson, formerly taught at a school for the deaf. He informs me that hand signing is actively discouraged in schools, and the emphasis in education is on forcing deaf children to learn to lip read and finger spell. He abandoned his position because the evidence suggests only thirty percent of normal speech can be visually speechread. The reason is because many spoken sounds are produced within the mouth and throat, and cannot be seen. In addition, many pairs look identical, such as 'p' and 'b'.

""I find that interesting, but only to the extent that the words people say often mean something else in any event. Listening to a long-married couple when they don't believe, or care, if they are overheard is a fine example. They communicate in a code developed over time. He complains the morning coffee is cold, but what he means is that he did not sleep well. She says she likes the tie he's wearing, but what she means is that she admires her husband. They finish each other's sentences. They convey much in silences.

""That may well be attributed to prolonged association, but strangers do it, too. Humans adopt the jargon of their trade, their social position, their gender, their culture.

""I wonder sometimes if moving past grunts and pointing has been that much of an advancement. And what about those who's first language is not vocal - those who speak through their art?

Sherlock, with the two hounds at his heels, was passing and, attracted by our conversation, he deigned to join us. 

""How pleasant. It's not often we converse on matters unrelated to the tasks at hand"", he said.

Miss Adler replied, ""I'm not sure we are very far afield. I think Mycroft's train of detection and my own run on parallel tracks. We listen, we look, and we judge if the observation of one affirms what is revealed by the other. We also wish to determine why people say what they do and act as they do. Does a man espouse a cause because he believes in it, or because it will do him some good? Does he trust because he believes, or is it that he hopes? When we have a true sense of why a person turns right instead of left we have an insight on what he will do next.""

""I cannot disagree. But for the vast number of those under our watchful eye it is a case of one foot following the other. Perhaps I am in danger of confusing simplistic with simple, but I look for patterns. Cause is not as critical for me.""

""That is why we are a good team, we compliment"", said Miss Adler.

I couldn't be sure if I was counted in the 'team' to which she referred. No matter. There was more discussion interspersed by comfortable interludes of silence. Sherlock became absorbed with bees which had strayed from the clover fields.

""I can sit and watch the bees for hours. Our middle European fellows, however, would undoubtedly draw different observations. What I witness is a ballet of cooperation. Whereas they would see a regimented hierarchy of plodders moving at the will of the queen. They would be incredulous that a monarchist such as myself could take away anything less.

""Do you know the queen is born a worker-bee and is nurtured into her role by other workers. In their egg state all bees are the same. A hive is almost egalitarian.

""I don't expect anyone would deny that the three of us possess exceptional talents, but the fact remains, we are all integral parts of a whole purpose, just as the bees first allegiance is to the hive.

""I'm quite certain I have a deserved reputation for not suffering fools, but I would myself be a fool if I rejected any contribution simply because it came from a source an elitist society might label the ‘lower ranks‘. I am not likely to forget it was our Gill as a young neophyte who set us on a significant path the colony now follows. Communities of men can achieve the totally unexpected when potential is allowed to demonstrate itself.”

I felt need to interject myself into this observation.

""I'd like to return to something Miss Adler was speaking of before you sat down. She questioned if moving past grunts and pointing has been that much of an advancement.

""Looking over the past century, the revolution of industry has allowed man to become almost god-like. With all of that, here we are spending our waking hours plumbing the possibilities of war - the ramifications of land war, sea war, under-sea war, can air war be the next?

""I worry what flaw exists in the grand scheme which demands the earthly scales keep heaven in balance with hell. At the end of this century will man have discovered a way to eradicate his entire race?

“Can either of you put name to another species which, by its own volition, threatens its own extinction?”

.

The weeks and months which followed represented a dramatic expansion of activity - at the colony and away. Days with no respite were frequent. Keeping track of internecine conflicts on the continent was increasingly daunting as the candles of reason flickered.

Miss Adler’s pupil numbers were increased from three to six per indoctrinal term. Boggs began instructing his own brood of auditors. Rice needed a cartographer and a referencer. Hauser needed a sous chef (I didn’t know what that entailed except it represented another body). Pencer needed “whatever help” we could afford to him. Wallace and Blocke filled in as best they could but to the neglect of their own specialties. We were strained at every seam. 

Sherlock had long been consumed with a certain German by the name of Von Bork who maintained a residence in Harwich on the Essex coast.. Von Bork was an intimate of Baron Von Herling, the chief secretary of the German legation at Prussia House in London.

For the purpose of enhancing the persona he played with Von Bork Sherlock had cultivated a goatee. Miss Adler claimed he looked positively rakish. It was good to see the colony had not lost its capacity for humor.

Meanwhile I could not find release from the dichotomy of irrational preparation for irrational war. The Royal Naval Dockyard at Rosyth, Scotland had been allocated £3,250,000 in 1903. It had not begun construction until 1909. It would not be functional until 1916.

Initially, Whitehall had to be forced fed the information we generated. Now they demanded everything we could deliver to them – and were dismayed when informed they couldn’t have it yesterday.

.

The little table outside of the paired cottages had become a hub of sorts where Miss Adler, Sherlock, and I would discuss and dissect all manner of things from the practical to the abstract. Matters affecting the colony were usually addressed in the mess with the members of the colony, and we three went out of our way to not be, or appear to be, autocratic. However, on this occasion in late July of 1914, we were at the table ruminating over the fate of the colony. Our portfolio was fast outgrowing the facility and the reasonable recourse would be to either move it or break it up. To a large extent, though, it owed its success in no small measure to where it was and the chemistry which had developed between the residents. It was decided to bring the problem to the mess for full airing. Taking the permanent residents away from their tasks all at the same time was more than problematic but there was no other recourse.

Miss Adler expressed the problem to our company. Over several hours we entertained various solutions along with individual hesitations and objections. I kept being reminded of Sherlock’s rational sentiment revelation. Not being a permanent resident I was able to maintain a slight reserve, but I could tell Hauser was shaken by the prospect of dissolving the band. The rest had their own feelings but professionalism prevented them from any exhibition.

Our members were devoted to maintaining the standards they set for themselves. There were no easy jobs here but everyone enjoyed what they did. In addition, although a cause might be difficult to articulate or to reconcile, it was not so much that the colony was greater than the individuals who comprised it, but that each, and I do count myself, was better for being part of it.

Ironically, it was Hauser’s question from many moons past which finally set us on the right path – “...would you really need your man to 'live in'?”

We set to making lists in each division of what could be done elsewhere, stored elsewhere, taught elsewhere. We could shunt many tasks to many locations, in many cases with fewer restrictions. Each of our principals would groom counterparts. Under the guidance of suitable instructors leagues of cadets could be produced following our model. We would train trainers.

The colony’s dilemma was satisfied in the same remarkable fashion which, over our time together, we had come to appreciate and to depend upon. It would adapt and evolve, as all things must.

.

And so, I must bring this short chronicle to a close because it, too, is in jeopardy of outgrowing its intended purpose. Historians will attempt to explain how the world arrived at such a perilous state. I’ll leave it to them. My self appointed task has merely been to record the efforts of one small assembly to construct a bulwark against the forces of bedlam. I have dipped my pen into the river of time and you have seen the result. Thanks to the good Dr. Watson you may be familiar with much that went before and, by the time this narrative has become available, you will probably be aware of what comes after.

No matter, I will keep finding excuses to pry myself away from London, board the Great Eastern Railway, and wend my way to the colony. My Pall Mall lodgings and the Diogenes Club are eminently comfortable but, oddly, I feel most content after giving over my safety to a roan with a penchant for honey covered apples.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 15 Mr. Wallace rightly insists I include the evolution of Mr. Rice's domain in any recital of the colony. Mr. Rice is equally firm on the subject. The reader should understand, though, each is in awe of the other’s accomplishments and wishes them recognized.

.

Mr. Rice is tasked with distilling and cataloguing the disparate bits of information which come in from Sherlock's informal sources and from our colony-trained scouts and their sources. Everything is archived and cross referenced. Rice has also become the facility's librarian.

Most of Sherlock's own collection now falls under Rice's care. Miss Adler and all of the permanent residents have contributed not insignificant numbers relating to their own fields of interest. The colony library is equal in size to that of a modest university. The ever-increasing volume of material is indexed by a decimal classification system. Every book, newspaper, text, or report is assigned a number which exactly locates a position relative to other material in the library on the basis of its subject. The number makes it simple to find any reference and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves.

In conjunction, engineer Wallace's efforts on behalf of Rice’s work have been nothing short of Herculean. The physical space Rice currently oversees is three times what he formerly owned. How that end was gained follows…

Wallace was presented with a three prong challenge - provide Rice with additional archival space, keep the facility unobtrusive, disrupt Rice as little as possible. Wallace spent several days examining the integrity of the existing building. Pronouncing it sound he turned his attentions to adjacent excavation for an ‘addition’. A large pit was dug to exact specifications and location. Into it concrete foundation walls and a floor were poured. A grid of metal rods was joined to reinforce a concrete ceiling which allowed for a center stairwell.

A dozen navvies from the Shorncliffe Military Camp had been employed up to that stage. On the final and critical day the number was tripled. A man was stationed every three feet around the perimeter of the original building, each was equipped with a five foot steel levering bar. The plan was to raise the structure one quarter of an inch at each command of “up”. Runners with shimming blocks would insure each raise, at each man. At a “down” command the lever fulcrums would be repositioned for the next raise. Wallace kept circling the project to make certain all was safe and true. In short order a chant developed... “up”,  “grunt”,  “down”,  “sigh”. And so it progressed.

When the desired height was attained dozens of four inch diameter poles were passed through the gap to allow the structure to be ‘rolled’ into its new position. Wallace was a dervish. As each pole became exposed at the rear it was brought to the fore. Finally, at its intended destination, the raising/lowering procedure resumed in reverse.

None of the building’s contents or furnishings had been removed, and all survived in tact. 

Not a book had dropped from a shelf. Not a map had fallen from a wall. The navvies insisted paper must have the same weight equivalent of granite.

Rice, who had been nervously watching for the entire time, claimed he was in need of a whiskey and a nap. Before he made his escape, however, he insisted on christening the new space with its first new volume. He produced a small blue book. On the cover was printed in golden letters, Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with Some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen, author, Sherlock Holmes.

Wallace and the workers repaired to the mess for a well deserved meal and a bit of self-congratulatory celebration warning that the colony’s meade stores might need replenishing before they were done.

.

A recent example of Mr. Rice's amazing facility for drawing lines from fragmentary dots is highlighted in the tragic tale of Alvar Hahn. The completed picture was supplied by our Berlin trio of Habib, Cottle, and Gill. The reader should appreciate the trail of crumbs Rice followed to bring the matter to the colony's attention were only determined to be of importance after the fact.

The first bit of puzzle was a newspaper report of a naval weapon’s advance being pursued by the Krupp ship works in Hamburg. A second, from Boggs our financial virtuoso, was of a consortium formed to finance a mechanism to improve the accuracy of naval gunnery. Boggs supplied a list of investors. Rice prompted our agent, Habib, to determine if any of the four principals were clients of Mr. Kappel at the Berenberg Bank. A Mr. Alvar Hahn was, and had a very sizeable overdue loan. Boggs came back to report that pressure was being applied to the original investors to increase their commitment and were being offered implausible returns to do so.

It was pieced together, again with suggestions from Rice, that the mechanism was indeed a valid undertaking. It was a gyro mounting for a large caliber ship's gun which would compensate for the rise and fall of a vessel when aiming in rough waters. The syndicate behind the investment, however, was straw. There was no path any profit could be realized in the short period promised.

With the hope of uncovering more details of the project, Habib, Cottle, and Gill reestablished temporary residence in Hamburg and, in turns, took to watching Hahn. They even discovered, with a little agility, they could see into his exclusive apartment by way of a skylight accessible from an adjoining building. And so it happened that Gill was witness from above when, only two nights after scrutiny of Hahn began, three men arrived at the man’s door.

Gill could not distinguish all of the preliminary conversation but, as it proceeded, voices were raised. The gist was that Hahn was in desperate need of a payment from his partners immediately or he would be ruined. In blunt terms he was told he was not the player he imagined himself to be and further, if he could not increase his stake in the scheme, he was out.

Hahn alternately threatened and pleaded with the men. They, in turn, scornfully pointed out, had he fully read their agreement, he would realize he was vulnerable and they were not. Hahn had been blinded by greed. He owed more than he was worth. He would be totally disgraced and sent to prison. The man was reduced to sobs.

With cold detachment his former 'partners' suggested Mr. Hahn was left with a single recourse. As the vile trinity made to leave, the last turned and placed a revolver on a table next to the door.

Hahn read the implied message and colapsed further into his seat and into abject dispair.

The voyeur, Gill, was as paralyzed by the preceding as was Hahn.

The pitiable creature sat for several minutes staring at the carpet between his feet, perhaps in hope there might be an answer woven into its pattern. At length he arose, went to a drinks cabinet, poured a large measure of liquor into a crystal glass, went to the door,  retrieved the revolver, and returned to his chair. There he sat, staring at his drink just as he had the carpet. 

After some time Hahn seemed to regain himself. He sipped at his drink. And when it was finished he picked up the gun, put it to his head and fired the weapon.

Gill could not believe what had just transpired. Much against his will he kept returning his gaze to the scene below to confirm that which his brain refused to fathom. At length he made his way off the roof and back to the company of Cottle and Habib.

Half an hour later the three were discussing the matter over their own drinks. Habib had several questions and seemed most able to disassociate his thinking from the horror. ""Could you see the gun after Hahn shot himself?"" Gill replied he could. ""Are you certain it was a revolver and not a pistol?"" He was. ""Might we reasonably condemn the three men as Hahn's ultimate murderers?"" Gill and Cottle agreed.

Habib outlined a plan. It would not require the three of them, but each wanted to take part. Cottle fetched a cylindrical canvas bag from their stock of identity disguising gear suggested by Sherlock, and they set off for Hahn's building.

After they attained the roof, Cottle extracted from the bag a three-part fishing rod. From the vantage of the open skylight he managed, within a few attempts, to snag the finger guard of the revolver. He then slowly reeled in the gun to their waiting hands.

Back again at their own accommodations they celebrated 'the perfect crime'. Hahn's tormentors would prove to be his last visitors. They would be identified by the building's concierge, and probably by others. They would be charged with his death. And they would, most reasonably, be convicted.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 14 This entry was supplied by Wallace...

The colony was between training sessions and it was coming on to Christmas. The brothers Holmes are not averse to a bit of gaiety - but, with all respect, one wouldn't expect or want them to organize it. Furthermore, a celebration of sentimentality would be completely out of the question. So it happened that preparations for the holiday fell to Hauser, Blocke, Rice, Pencer, Stewart, and myself.

Pencer and I justified the procurement of the latest recording and playing instrument from the Victor Talking Machine Co. as a 'gift' for the whole community. Several cylinders by the world famous tenor Enrico Caruso were earmarked for Miss Adler. 

Hauser became a man possessed. If the pages formulated for London were lengthy and secret, those were nothing compared to the recipes (we could only suppose) being husbanded by our cook. He locked them away at night. His weekly food requisition doubled - and the occasion was still a fortnight away.

Stewart volunteered to make centerpieces for the dining table and side tables. Blocke and Rice became as secretive as Hauser.

The principals were informed there would be a special dinner and everyone would be expected to contribute an 'entertainment'.

Blocke and Rice added Miss Adler to their intrigue.

.

All members of the colony had been warned away from the mess building for the morning of Christmas day. Light breakfast had been left at our doors. Only two people, Hauser and Stewart, moved inside the forbidden building, and the various aromas which made their escape tortured us and made us salivate with anticipation.

On the stroke of 1 pm. the dinner bell rang. No one was too far afield to miss it. We crowded in and were dazzled. Garlands of evergreen draped about the room. Red ribbons, holly, and dozens of lit candles created a storybook tableau of what Christmas should look like. It was picture perfect - not too much, nor too little, nothing garish, everything tasteful and warm. The centerpiece of the dining table was a work of art.

Hauser and Steward were setting out paté, terrine, prawn cocktail cups with Marie Rose sauce and smoked salmon with horseradish, crème fraîche &amp; beetroot.

Aside: if the reader thinks I could identify all of these enticing 'starters' he would be sorely in error. Hauser provided me with a menu after the fact.

Second aside: I was in such awe of the culinary delights and the room's enchanting transformation I almost failed to notice that everyone was starched, and trimmed, and combed. As my mother would say, ""They cleaned up nice.""

On the main table were various bottles of wine and a delicious honey mead fermented here at the compound by Hauser. (He used it to bribe the men who delivered our stores from the Shorncliffe Camp to insure we received the freshest of the fresh produce.) Also available were raspberry Champagne cocktail and cranberry, fresh pear and cinnamon bubbles.

If we thought the entrées could not be surpassed, we were open to be bowled well over.

Third aside: Only in America is the entrée the main meal. In French cuisine, and in every other part of the world, an entrée is a prelude to a larger course within a single meal.

Plates were cleared for the main course - mustard butter-basted roast turkey with bacon and roast beef with Yorkshire puddings. The sides were parsnips, honey-roasted carrots, potatoes, and the traditional pigs-in-blankets and bacon, sausage, and prune rolls. The sauces were port &amp; cranberry sauce with juniper, and gravy.

.

Dinner was complete, the table cleared and pushed to the side, and the dishware were put to soak. Miss Adler insisted everyone take a stroll to aid digestion and walk off the lethargy induced by eating too much. We would return for dessert, a thought inconceivable at the time.

It was a beautiful, crisp, but not cold, afternoon. The lady's countermeasure proved itself by the time we returned to the mess. Plum pudding, homemade custard, and royal cherry trifle might just be considered.

Pencer and I set up the phonograph and played a Caruso aria conducted by Walter B. Rogers while the party settled themselves with drinks and tobacco. Miss Adler was quite pleased with the music.

It was time for the entertainment.

Mycroft arose and addressed the group. ""My reservoir of amusements is meager at best, so I beg you not to mind if I borrow a tale from my brother's good friend and Boswell, Dr. Watson. It was never consigned to print because it featured the doctor himself. So, it will be new to you all, and perhaps even to Sherlock. It is a bit risqué. In advance I beg your forgiveness.""

I cannot relate Mycroft's telling in full, but it was delivered superbly.

.

In short... Late one night the doctor was called to certify the apparent death of a bishop. When he arrived at the manse, the priest's housekeeper was in a state approaching hysteria and a cleric, who introduced himself as the secretary, was not much improved. Watson was led upstairs to the bedrooms. Entering the door indicated he saw instantly what had affected the aforementioned pair.

On a very large four poster bed was a corpulent male body, presumably the bishop, looking quite dead. The shocking element, however, was that he was handcuffed to two young women - one on each wrist. The women were trying to cover themselves as best they could and, at the same time, trying to move as far from the dead man as best they could.

Knowing as he uttered the question it had been asked already, ""Where is the key?""

""He swallowed it,"" one of the ladies answered.

""We were sampling some of the church wine. He became tipsy, said he felt like he'd died and gone to heaven, laughed, popped the key into his mouth, took another sip of wine and swallowed both wine and key. A minute later he just stopped breathing and, and he died,"" She gave a shiver and a sob with the last.

Immediately ruling out most options because of scandal, Watson directed the secretary to wake the nearest blacksmith and bring back a hacksaw - without the blacksmith.

While the secretary was gone, Watson did what he could to confirm the key was not lodged in the bishop's throat. He introduced himself to the comely pair. They, in turn, identified themselves as Chalice and Grail Throckton. They proudly admitted to being in charge of arranging the chapel flowers.

Examining the deceased for the key entailed some difficulty due to the springing of the bed, the girth of the gentleman, and the proximity of the ladies. Finally convinced it was not retrievable, Watson regained the stability, and safety, of the floor.

It must have been soon, but seemed forever, the secretary returned with a hacksaw. Watson put him to work while the ladies argued about who was to be released first. The doctor and the secretary took turns at the cuffs. One was released but remained to wait for her sister. Freed, and clothed, they were sent home. Watson performed a more detailed examination of the body.

The good doctor was then faced with the more difficult task of confirming the cause of death. Scandal aside, he wasn't going to lie. Chalice and Grail, indeed! He mulled on the subject for a time and eventually he wrote, ""Cause of death, heart attack while in his cups."" Let anyone make of that as they would.

Our assembly laughed so hard we were in tears.

Next to come forth were Blocke and Rice. With concertina and recorder they regaled us with Once in Royal David's City, O Holy Night, and God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen. We all sang along.

Then Miss Adler joined the pair. A hush fell because it was known she had once been prima donna of the Imperial Opera of Warsaw.

There must have been a trick of light, but it was as though a spotlight fell upon her and she was the only person in the room. She sang the Coventry Carol and then the Wexford Carol. Her voice was still nothing shy of magnificent.

When the company had recovered from Miss Adler's spell, Sherlock stepped forward. ""I have nothing to offer this dedicated, hard working, congenial, selfless band but my most heartfelt admiration, and thanks."" As he said these words he unwrapped what was apparently a framed award or testament of some sort. ""You should be apprised it is not just I who hold these sentiments. What I have in my hands is the badge of the Order of St Michael and St George. Never before has it been bestowed upon a group of people - until now. Accompanying the award is this message, 'In full appreciation from a grateful nation for services rendered to the Crown' It bears the seal of King George V.""

The silver frame measured approximately 10 inches by 10 inches. The badge itself was a starburst affair. In the center was a depiction of St. George defeating the dragon and around that was a legend, 'Auspicium Melioris Aevi'. I found later the translation from Rice, ‘Token Of A Better Age‘. It would hang in prominence on the mess wall for all to draw encouragement.

Not long thereafter members began to drift back to their respective quarters, apparently not wishing to diminish the magic of the day by refusing to let it end. It would never be forgotten by any of us.

Knowing as he uttered the question it had been asked already, ""Where is the key?""

""He swallowed it,"" one of the ladies answered.

""We were sampling some of the church wine. He became tipsy, said he felt like he'd died and gone to heaven, laughed, popped the key into his mouth, took another sip of wine and swallowed both wine and key. A minute later he just stopped breathing and, and he died,"" She gave a shiver and a sob with the last.

Immediately ruling out most options because of scandal, Watson directed the secretary to wake the nearest blacksmith and bring back a hacksaw - without the blacksmith.

While the secretary was gone, Watson did what he could to confirm the key was not lodged in the bishop's throat. He introduced himself to the comely pair. They, in turn, identified themselves as Chalice and Grail Throckton. They proudly admitted to being in charge of arranging the chapel flowers.

Examining the deceased for the key entailed some difficulty due to the springing of the bed, the girth of the gentleman, and the proximity of the ladies. Finally convinced it was not retrievable, Watson regained the stability, and safety, of the floor.

It must have been soon, but seemed forever, the secretary returned with a hacksaw. Watson put him to work while the ladies argued about who was to be released first. The doctor and the secretary took turns at the cuffs. One was released but remained to wait for her sister. Freed, and clothed, they were sent home. Watson performed a more detailed examination of the body.

The good doctor was then faced with the more difficult task of confirming the cause of death. Scandal aside, he wasn't going to lie. Chalice and Grail, indeed! He mulled on the subject for a time and eventually he wrote, ""Cause of death, heart attack while in his cups."" Let anyone make of that as they would.

Our assembly laughed so hard we were in tears.

Next to come forth were Blocke and Rice. With concertina and recorder they regaled us with Once in Royal David's City, O Holy Night, and God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen. We all sang along.

Then Miss Adler joined the pair. A hush fell because it was known she had once been prima donna of the Imperial Opera of Warsaw.

There must have been a trick of light, but it was as though a spotlight fell upon her and she was the only person in the room. She sang the Coventry Carol and then the Wexford Carol. Her voice was still nothing shy of magnificent.

When the company had recovered from Miss Adler's spell, Sherlock stepped forward. ""I have nothing to offer this dedicated, hard working, congenial, selfless band but my most heartfelt admiration, and thanks."" As he said these words he unwrapped what was apparently a framed award or testament of some sort. ""You should be apprised it is not just I who hold these sentiments. What I have in my hands is the badge of the Order of St Michael and St George. Never before has it been bestowed upon a group of people - until now. Accompanying the award is this message, 'In full appreciation from a grateful nation for services rendered to the Crown' It bears the seal of King George V.""

The silver frame measured approximately 10 inches by 10 inches. The badge itself was a starburst affair. In the center was a depiction of St. George defeating the dragon and around that was a legend, 'Auspicium Melioris Aevi'. I found later the translation from Rice, ‘Token Of A Better Age‘. It would hang in prominence on the mess wall for all to draw encouragement.

Not long thereafter members began to drift back to their respective quarters, apparently not wishing to diminish the magic of the day by refusing to let it end. It would never be forgotten by any of us.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 13 I had been out in the British hinterlands, something I find disagreeable at the best of times. I do not care for things to be out of place, particularly me. So, to say I was disconcerted as the colony came into view would be understatement. I was forced to hesitate and consider that some delayed hallucination might be affecting my brain. The cause, though, was immediately apparent - and founded in fact. There were now two cottages. The second being a mirror of, but at right angles to, the original. It was, of course, at the beginnings of construction and not yet habitable. But I had not been forewarned. I was not prepared.

Sherlock was seated at an outside table looking very comfortable with a closed book in his lap, not asleep but in reverie.

""Sherlock, I don't believe I've seen you so content in quite some time.""

""Good afternoon, Mycroft.

""A partial reason I am pleased is that the carpenters have taken their lunch and, at least for the moment, ceased their infernal racket.

""I apologize for not consulting you, but the plan Miss Adler put forth for expanding her quarters would have more than doubled its size. I decided the prudent remedy was to start from scratch. More convenient for her but, as it transpires, less so for me.

""Fortunately though, that irritation is being mitigated by a feeling of personal triumph. I am basking in the resolve of a most difficult, intriguing and long enduring dilemma. It may take some time for substantiation, but I'm as confident today as can be.

""We have touched on the matter before... I have been conducting a self interrogation, an introspection, if you will. I've strenuously pulled at the threads of Miss Adler's 'rational sentiment' garment and found it sturdy and, just perhaps, suitable to wear. I am come to conclude that contentment is when a man's logic and his emotions coincide. And it is fair to pronounce that melding... reasonable.""

""As you say, Sherlock, that is indeed more than reasonable. Have you discussed this with the lady?"", I inquired.

""What a preposterous thought, Mycroft. Why ever should I do such a thing? What's it got to do with her?""

.

""I was at Sherlock's cottage when the telephone rang through with my three-short code. It was Mrs. Hudson and I therefore knew it was important.""

""Mr. Holmes"", she breathlessly began, ""I apologize for bothering you, but I have a concern which only you can address.

""Early this morning a military gentleman arrived at the house. He produced a letter of authorization which he purported to be from your office. He claimed he was in the city for a meeting with you and requested a place to await your return.

""It took me a few moments to realize his attire looked 'off'. He wore the uniform of the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, but the badging was wrong. I only know this because my nephew belongs to that regiment and has bored me to tears with it's history. He's a sweet fellow but his conversation is that of a nephew who can think of nothing else to discuss with an aunt he rarely sees.

""The gentleman at the door acted as though he believed this to be your home. I thought it odd, but I am used to odd.

""I told him you might be quite late getting back and I showed him to a room and went for fresh linens. When I returned he was freshening up in the bath. I knocked and told him I was leaving towels at the door and changing the bed should he wish to use it. As I did so I looked around to see if everything was in order. The room was fine, but several of the gentleman's belongings also seemed not quite right. That prompted me to look into his valise. At the bottom was a Luger pistol. 

""This could all have an innocent explanation, although do I know your people are sticklers for detail and do not make trivial mistakes. But perhaps it is my unforgivable sin questioning your associates.""

""Mrs. Hudson, you are perfectly correct to suspect this person. I am now worried about your safety. I can send officers to apprehend him, but if he is armed you may be in great danger.""

""No, no, Mr. Holmes, please do not distress yourself. I might not have admitted it if my judgement was wrong, but the gentleman will be no threat for most of the day. I offered him soup for lunch which he accepted and consumed with gusto. The soup contained a large dose of castor oil. I promise he will be agitated but of no threat when your officers arrive.""

""I was at Sherlock's cottage when the telephone rang through with my three-short code. It was Mrs. Hudson and I therefore knew it was important.""

""Mr. Holmes"", she breathlessly began, ""I apologize for bothering you, but I have a concern which only you can address.

""Early this morning a military gentleman arrived at the house. He produced a letter of authorization which he purported to be from your office. He claimed he was in the city for a meeting with you and requested a place to await your return.

""It took me a few moments to realize his attire looked 'off'. He wore the uniform of the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, but the badging was wrong. I only know this because my nephew belongs to that regiment and has bored me to tears with it's history. He's a sweet fellow but his conversation is that of a nephew who can think of nothing else to discuss with an aunt he rarely sees.

""The gentleman at the door acted as though he believed this to be your home. I thought it odd, but I am used to odd.

""I told him you might be quite late getting back and I showed him to a room and went for fresh linens. When I returned he was freshening up in the bath. I knocked and told him I was leaving towels at the door and changing the bed should he wish to use it. As I did so I looked around to see if everything was in order. The room was fine, but several of the gentleman's belongings also seemed not quite right. That prompted me to look into his valise. At the bottom was a Luger pistol. 

""This could all have an innocent explanation, although do I know your people are sticklers for detail and do not make trivial mistakes. But perhaps it is my unforgivable sin questioning your associates.""

""Mrs. Hudson, you are perfectly correct to suspect this person. I am now worried about your safety. I can send officers to apprehend him, but if he is armed you may be in great danger.""

""No, no, Mr. Holmes, please do not distress yourself. I might not have admitted it if my judgement was wrong, but the gentleman will be no threat for most of the day. I offered him soup for lunch which he accepted and consumed with gusto. The soup contained a large dose of castor oil. I promise he will be agitated but of no threat when your officers arrive.""

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 12 The most enigmatic of our new members is Habib. When his selection was being reviewed, Sherlock and I were noncommittal. Miss Adler was a strong proponent. We agreed if she felt so strongly he was worth a trial.

His physical attributes are so nondescript as to render him almost memorable for his unremarkability. He is of somewhat darker skin and could have originated from almost anywhere. He was, in fact, born at St Giles Hospital in the heart of London to Maltese parents who had emigrated from the protectorate two years before his birth. His father worked for the Anglo-Egyptian Bank.

Habib does have one unique feature. His eyes seem to focus on everything within their range but the oddity is that he can shut down that facility instantly. He may go from heightened concentration, lending the impression of singular intelligence, to vacuity, making one wonder if he is simple-minded. Witnessing the transformation can be very disconcerting.

Whether there is a connection or not, Mr. Habib has informed us he is color blind. Sherlock was aware of this phenomenon. It is the inability or decreased ability to see color, or perceive color differences, under normal lighting conditions. There is no actual blindness, but there is a deficiency of color vision.

Some color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflages. There is also a belief that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal vision are not able to see.

The former has borne out with Habib. All of the colony buildings which might appear discordant from a distance are painted in a manner to disguise their use or even existence. He has made valuable suggestions for improvement. He spotted our radio towers immediately.

.

Our third candidate, Hensen, I am displeased to report, did not pan out. A week into his training he attempted to enter Miss Adler's cottage in the middle of the night. The lady is a light sleeper. She broke his nose. He was spirited from the colony before his head could clear. His first and only instructor, Blocke, made assurances to us that Hensen had gained nothing which might compromise our purpose or location. We do, however, hope he learned a lesson.

.

The original idea behind our continental infiltrators was to dispatch them idividually to various regions as needs arose. What we were coming to respect was the more we learned, the more we needed to learn. There was a need to broaden Sherlock's original web of amateur irregulars. There was a need to have knowledgeable agents in place before their services might be called upon. And, finally, there was a need for those local agents to be steeped in the cultural fabric.

.

Cottle and Habib were nearing the end of their training and, more important, gaining a sense of what they were being trained for. The pair approached Miss Adler to ask if it were possible they might take on their assignments as a team. The duo had become chums. Their aptitudes did not coincide but Miss Adler determined their proficiencies did compliment each other. Cottle was more gregarious, more physical, more 'one of the lads'. Habib was quicker of mind, could almost vanish in a crowd, and was hyper sensitive to nuance.
We decided this was not merely acceptable but desirable. And we had just the place to send them. All strands of a cause-and-effect web were leading to Berlin.

We gave Pencer a week to devise a secure communication plan and Rice the same to devise a code if one were required. The mail could only be depended upon so far. It was determined Gill would sail with Cottle and Habib to Hamburg. He would judge if that city were suitable for our revised stratagem. Before departing, the three would undergo intense immersion in the German language under Blocke.

.

The following is a pieced-together log of their first months.

Both Hamburg and Berlin were meccas for travelers, businessmen, and wielders of power. While Gill settled himself in Hamburg, Cottle and Habib did the same in Berlin. The latter pair framed a scheme casting Cottle as a card sharp looking to 'pluck some pigeons'. He went about dressed with a bit of flash drafting street urchins to keep him apprised of who visited the city's public and private clubs. He also kept in his mind the rogues who could have other talents. There were several who sported the look of a budding pickpocket or purse snatcher.

Another subset in his collection of acolytes obviously kept their eyes and ears open all of the time. These he cultivated with an extra coin or two. It was from them he learned of other haunts frequented by the 'privileged' class - places boys of their age should have been sheltered from.

While each day Cottle was incentivising his waifs at the sausage vendors, Habib was compiling lists of industries within the city. Gill was doing the same in Hamburg. The Berlin pair decided Cottle should take his show on the road. Cottle introduced Habib to his  favored irregulars as his 'partner' and instructed them to deal with Habib while he would be absent from the city for a few days.

.

Cottle took the overnight train to Hamburg and met with Gill. Gill had been combing his city and expanding his own lists. Cottle told of his success with the street boys and the intention of doing the same in Hamburg. Gill allowed that Hamburg was more cosmopolitan than Berlin and its dens of diversion were less visible and accessible to dirty urchins. His suggestion was to cultivate the bellboys and maids at the vacation hotels to discover who might be dining, recreating, and having intimate conversations with whom. Following this course yielded a flood of sordid gossip, too much to sift through for actual leads. Notwithstanding, Cottle did manage an invitation to a card game with five industrialists. He barely came away with his shirt, and little else.

Cottle and Gill discussed their options. Moguls and magnates might be loose on the ground in Hamburg, but they were either vacationers in the city for diversion or circumspect residents.
Gill, ""We should try another city or another field of inquiry in this city. The Port of Hamburg is a customs and duty-free zone. It has the largest warehouse district in the world. It has been an important financial center for centuries, and is the seat of the world's second oldest bank, Berenberg Bank.""

Cottle, ""I believe you have identified the problem. We have been the wrong people in the right city. Are you up for gainful employment?""

.

They sent a telegram to Habib that afternoon, ""Come if you're free - or reasonable.""

Habib arrived the following day. Gill elaborated on the city's main features and Cottle's plan.

""I will seek a job at the port, Gill at the warehouses, and you at the bank. The first two are always hiring casual labor. The third might be questionable.""

As it happened, the bank was favorably impressed and agreed to take on the very intelligent looking young man who's father had been an executive with the Anglo-Egyptian Bank.

.

Habib's position was nothing to give him access to the type of records the colony would find of value, but it did provide him with an introduction to others in the bank's employ. Particularly, he identified the gentleman in charge of commercial loans, Mr. Kappel, and three young women who had lower-level positions like himself. He noticed the loan officer was often distracted when one of the 'girls' happened to pass his desk.

At the noon break he found the young ladies together eating their bagged lunches. He introduced himself as new to the city and, in the course of conversation, asked if they could recommend a place to have a meal and a beer after work.

They were polite, obliging, and did name a nearby rathskeller. He, in turn, invited them to join him that evening as his guests, so he might not dine alone.

Habib made it a point to be seen by Kappel when the quartet left together.

.

Things at the bank continued as planned. Habib courted the friendship of the young women. He also went out of his way to be noticed by Kappel. The reticent and older Kappel, believing he too might be noticed by the young women were he on friendly terms with Habib, was more gracious to the new employee than might be anticipated.

Picking a topic he already had some familiarity with, Habib contrived to invite Kappel to share dinner with him under the guise of wishing guidance in his work. Kappel, who would have shunned the company away from the bank under usual circumstances, appreciated the younger man was looking for a mentor. He agreed.

The meal went well. Habib, given he was not as ignorant of the subject as he pretended, proved a quick learner. In addition, he managed to impress the gullible Kappel with a few tales about his banker father. 

On the distaff side, Habib managed to have the ladies introduced to his friend, Cottle. This took away much of the burden of having to be constantly entertaining, something Cottle could do without effort. Gill was brought into the mix a few days later. None of the ladies was singled out for attention, but clearly they were now drawn by more than just a free meal.

.

A few weeks passed when tragedy struck. Habib had secured tickets for a much touted musical review and the six were to attend. At the last minute, Gill had to bow out due to a work-related emergency. Habib approached Kappel with his quandary - six expensive tickets and only two gentlemen able to escort three ladies. Would it be a terrible imposition for Kappel to aid in this time of dire need?

Kappel proved not to be an impediment upon the evening, and the ladies took the substitution in stride. Success!

.

While the preparations for this confluence were being arranged, Habib, Cottle, and Gill had also been acquiring masses of information - information which meant nothing to them. The trio required guidance.

Much of this information had been passed along to the colony, but only some of it had been stitched together. It was time to deploy a more competent resource.

Habib was pleased to inform his 'friend' Kappel, that a close family associate would be vacationing in Hamburg for a week and Habib would be gratified if the two could meet. Kappel, who now was basking in a world previously unknown to him, would be delighted. He insisted on playing host. Reservations were made at the most expensive restaurant of his ken. He even purchased a new suit. Who would have thought the acquaintance of a clerk would lead to dining with a personage who could afford to holiday in his city - for an entire week?

Ignatius Boggs appeared on the scene looking as though he had come from a regal wine tasting. He exuded privilege. He was introduced under the fictitious name of Wheller and, in conversation, confided to Kappel that when he chose to work, he 'dabbled'. The pair got on famously, so famously they agreed to dine, sans Habib, later in the week.

Our ladies were similarly awe struck by Wheller. He charmed them by being interested in their duties at the bank and even had some questions. As a matter of fact he had questions for all of us. When he and the three of us were alone he scribbled reams of them. There were lists of queries for each of us and data he wanted Habib to obtain from the 'girls' - he called them that, too. They didn't seem to mind.

The week with Boggs was grueling. He created dozens of something called spreadsheets filled with hieroglyphics. At the end he rolled them into a pair of binocular cavities and was off.

Two weeks after the Boggs' siege on Hamburg, the ladies were informed Gill and Cottle were signing onto to a freighter. They could be gone for more than a month. Two weeks following, Habib's great uncle died and he requested leave to console his grieving relatives.

The trio repaired to Berlin.

On the distaff side, Habib managed to have the ladies introduced to his friend, Cottle. This took away much of the burden of having to be constantly entertaining, something Cottle could do without effort. Gill was brought into the mix a few days later. None of the ladies was singled out for attention, but clearly they were now drawn by more than just a free meal.

.

A few weeks passed when tragedy struck. Habib had secured tickets for a much touted musical review and the six were to attend. At the last minute, Gill had to bow out due to a work-related emergency. Habib approached Kappel with his quandary - six expensive tickets and only two gentlemen able to escort three ladies. Would it be a terrible imposition for Kappel to aid in this time of dire need?

Kappel proved not to be an impediment upon the evening, and the ladies took the substitution in stride. Success!

.

While the preparations for this confluence were being arranged, Habib, Cottle, and Gill had also been acquiring masses of information - information which meant nothing to them. The trio required guidance.

Much of this information had been passed along to the colony, but only some of it had been stitched together. It was time to deploy a more competent resource.

Habib was pleased to inform his 'friend' Kappel, that a close family associate would be vacationing in Hamburg for a week and Habib would be gratified if the two could meet. Kappel, who now was basking in a world previously unknown to him, would be delighted. He insisted on playing host. Reservations were made at the most expensive restaurant of his ken. He even purchased a new suit. Who would have thought the acquaintance of a clerk would lead to dining with a personage who could afford to holiday in his city - for an entire week?

Ignatius Boggs appeared on the scene looking as though he had come from a regal wine tasting. He exuded privilege. He was introduced under the fictitious name of Wheller and, in conversation, confided to Kappel that when he chose to work, he 'dabbled'. The pair got on famously, so famously they agreed to dine, sans Habib, later in the week.

Our ladies were similarly awe struck by Wheller. He charmed them by being interested in their duties at the bank and even had some questions. As a matter of fact he had questions for all of us. When he and the three of us were alone he scribbled reams of them. There were lists of queries for each of us and data he wanted Habib to obtain from the 'girls' - he called them that, too. They didn't seem to mind.

The week with Boggs was grueling. He created dozens of something called spreadsheets filled with hieroglyphics. At the end he rolled them into a pair of binocular cavities and was off.

Two weeks after the Boggs' siege on Hamburg, the ladies were informed Gill and Cottle were signing onto to a freighter. They could be gone for more than a month. Two weeks following, Habib's great uncle died and he requested leave to console his grieving relatives.

The trio repaired to Berlin.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 11 Our new scouts were an eclectic trio. Aside from a heightened ability to observe and retain, we didn't wish to limit what might be presented to us. We went about hunting for a financial sleuth in the same manner, but the ultimate answer fell into our lap by total chance.

Finding competent actuaries, analysts, and auditors was not difficult. That, however, was not exactly what we needed. The very best we interviewed were honest men and, to the contrary, we required someone at least as knowledgeable about the dishonest side of things.

Sherlock, Miss Adler, and I were discussing that dilemma in the mess one afternoon. Hauser was bustling about in preparation for the evening meal. We thought nothing of his overhearing our conversation until he gave us one of those I-hate-to-interrupt throat clearings.

""I hope you won't find this suggestion presumptuous."" he said. ""When I was a guest of the Pentonville Prison, there was another inmate by the name of Ignatius Boggs. I became acquainted with him because he worked in the garden. He was a legend among the other prisoners. It was claimed he could make a ledger sing like a operatic score. If my memory serves correctly he still has many years on his term, but would you really need your man to 'live in'?

I arranged for an officious official to speak with the prison warden. Said conversation elicited that Boggs, having been sentenced on multiple charges, would indeed be confined for quite some time. The warden did allow, however, that Boggs, other than his propensity for taking a shilling from your column and shifting it onto his own, was a model prisoner and a very likeable fellow.

The officious official spoke directly to Boggs and explained that His Majesty's government would be appreciative - in the form of continuing aids to Mr. Boggs comfort - for his occasional skills in analyzing financial dealings to discover what was really at the heart. Boggs was assured that the object of these inquiries would be foreigners lest honor among his thieving cohorts be a concern. 

Boggs responded that he would be pleased to be of service. 

.

Our friend Boggs immediately proved to be an invaluable asset. Not only could he track the path of any group investments, he could usually identify the individuals it comprised. Provided with a biography of the participants, he would give us reasons, other than the expected profit motive, why and how those individuals were included. In other words, who had access to privileged information and to whom he passed it along.

There did, however, occur a glitch in this arrangement.

Boggs had expressed a desire to continue his outdoor duties and requested from the warden, as part of his raised status, improved and additional gardening implements. These included, but were not restricted to, bamboo canes and jute cord to support his British runner beans.

A month from becoming our expert on financial matters, Ignatius Boggs fashioned a series of ladders and did a bunk from Pentonville Prison. His escape was more contrived than that, but the result would not change by going into more detail. In the investment investigation arena, the colony was back to square one.

Two weeks passed and we were still laboring to fill a gap we didn't know existed two months earlier. As it happened, though, a letter addressed to my officious official was forwarded to me. It read...

&gt; Please excuse my opportunistic leave of absence. I hold no grudges if you don't. In fact, I am open to resuming my activities if you'd care. From the glimpses I've seen so far, I believe doing so would be for the good of my country which I do dearly love - despite it's not loving me sometimes - for understandable reasons. In addition, being at liberty outside of the UK I may even be able to offer better service with greater access to more external instruction.

&gt; If you are amenable please advise in care of the address below.

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt;  Ignatius Boggs

","Our new scouts were an eclectic trio. Aside from a heightened ability to observe and retain, we didn't wish to limit what might be presented to us. We went about hunting for a financial sleuth in the same manner, but the ultimate answer fell into our lap by total chance.

Finding competent actuaries, analysts, and auditors was not difficult. That, however, was not exactly what we needed. The very best we interviewed were honest men and, to the contrary, we required someone at least as knowledgeable about the dishonest side of things.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 10 I observed an entertaining and enlightening incident in the mess one evening soon after our new residents arrived. Young Stewart, Gill's replacement, was in conversation with cadet Cottle. Cottle was explaining the intricacies of the dartboard which hangs on the mess wall.

""This is a London board. It has a doubles ring, a triples ring, and a double bullseye within a single bullseye. There also exist elsewhere a Manchester board with no triples ring, and a Lincoln board with no triples and no double bullseye. The random numbers around the outside define the wedges dividing the circle into twenty pie-shaped segments. The single bullseye scores 25.

""Many regional games may be played on a dartboard. The most standard game played all across England is called '301'. To begin, a player needs to throw a dart into the outside doubles ring. The score of that dart and all subsequent scores subtract from 301. The player throws 3 darts on each of his turns. The winning dart must reduce his score to exactly zero by hitting a double. So, if a player has 4 remaining, he will win by hitting the double 2. If he hits a single 2 in that effort, he will win by hitting a double 1. Should he 'bust', go over his number, his turn ends and on his next turn he will begin from where he began on the last.

""You seem very knowledgeable, Mr. Cottle.""

""Not wishing to brag, but I have taken my share of wagers. The skill has kept my glass full in many taverns.""

Hauser, our cook, was sitting within earshot and spoke up. ""You should challenge Miss Adler. She, too, is quite adept. None of us are up to matching her. We call her 'The Crusher'. It would be a pleasure to see her compete against someone on her level.""

Cottle could not keep the amusement out of his voice. ""A woman dart player, a capable woman dart player? That would be more than remarkable.""

Just then the subject of conversation walked through the door. Hauser called her over and suggested Cottle would like to witness her proficiency on the board.

Water glasses on a side-wall shelf held individual sets of darts. Cottle judged that those who played had made their own from needles or nails, wood dowels, and various forms of vanes at the rear. Some were works of art and some were primitive. Miss Adler plucked out a set that seemed serviceable but unremarkable.

""I encourage our team to learn how to throw darts, not so much as a game or even a weaponry defense, but as a mental discipline. It is a Zen-like exercise - can you instruct your body to act with the precision of a machine?""

She walked to the throw line, took aim, and put her three darts in a relatively tight center group. Cottle was obviously taken aback. He was game, though. He asked to examine her darts. He hefted them a few times and asked if she'd mind if he threw them. She obliged. He proceeded to put up a close group himself. They went back and forth a half dozen times. Her's were always a bit better, but not by much.

By this time Sherlock and I had come in and joined the watchers. Miss Adler suggested a change. She went to the line, threw her first dart. It was as good as any she'd launched so far. She took a step forward and put the second next to the first. Then she took two steps back and her third dart rubbed shoulders with the others.

Thinking that was no great accomplishment Cottle pulled the darts from the board and took position at the line. His first dart may have been better than her's had been. At a step forward his second flew high, almost at the triple ring. Addled, he took two steps back, threw his dart. It barely missed the bottom of the board.
The Crusher had struck again. Sherlock turned away to hide a smile.

It took a moment or two but Cottle was not ready to give in. ""That is most impressive and I bow to your skill. I do have another request, though."" He proceeded to explain the rules of the 301 game and suggested they play - with a wager. The stakes being her choice.
She considered the proposition. He was clearly goading her.

""Everyone here but myself and the Messrs. Holmes (by that time every resident was in the room) takes a turn each morning stoking up the kitchen fires for the day. I will take that duty for anyone who bests me at the 301 game and I will double my opponent's score each turn. If you throw 40 points, it will count as 80."" This was delivered with great braggadocio. ""If I win there will be no penalty for the loser, and I insist on extending the advantage to everyone.""

The last was a blatant taunt to Cottle.

En masse they thought it great fun.

As main contender and instigator, the first match would be Cottle's. He won the option to throw first. His initial dart was a double 20, followed by a single 20, the third was a triple 20. 
The watchers applauded. His thrown score was 120 points and doubling made it 240 which, when subtracted from 301, left 61.

He retrieved the darts from the board and handed them to Miss Adler. She accepted them with her left hand and extended her right to shake hands. ""Nice game. Thank you.""

He looked bewildered.

She said, without malice of any sort, ""There is nothing you can throw which, when doubled, will leave you with a number divisible by 2. You can't win.""

It took the onlookers full minutes to accept her words. As each did he began to laugh until the entire room was laughing - including Cottle.

Miss Adler joined Sherlock and myself. She was the first to voice the concern going through each of our minds. ""If we are to interpret the financial dealings of the countries under our scrutiny the next addition to the colony must be someone who understands numbers.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 9 Miss Adler, Sherlock, and I continued the conversation later in the cottage.

""I will suggest there are two issues we ought to address, one immediate, and the second, our near future. At present a reconnaissance of Keil seems in order, but not at the expense of our senior people nor at the frugality of entrusting it to the irregulars. I will put forth that young Gill shows a potential which might best be tested by such a mission. He is unassuming. He needn't be particularly cautious in his travel, and the German rail system could put him there in reasonable time. I'd like you to consider approaching him on the subject and gauging his reaction.

""That brings me to my second point. If Gill is to be absent for the better part of a month the colony shall need a replacement and coincidentally, and more important, should he live up to expectations, we should consider hatching more of him.

""What I have in mind is the establishment of a greenhouse for scouts. Suitable recruits would work along side our staff members who would, in turn, act as tutors, instructing them how to use their acquired skills in the field. I further recommend that the most qualified person to guide this project, if we adopt it, is you, Miss Adler. Head mistress of a spy school, I think, would suit your own gifts admirably.

.

Gill, in his reserved way, was pleased to take on more challenging duties. As it turned out he possessed a smattering of German which we buffered up with some technical basics and terms, and an amateur's talent with a box roll-film camera.

The day his replacement arrived he was sent off.

After much evaluation our first students arrived. Worth mentioning at this point is that, pass or fail, they would not be allowed to know where they had been trained.

We had decided three would be an optimal number. They would rotate individually between Wallace, Blocke, and Rice, spending two weeks with each, and then, back together, two weeks with Miss Adler (and when possible, Sherlock). They were also obliged to lend a hand in the kitchen when called for to offset their added burden on Hauser.

.

On his return young Gill, which we will have to stop calling him since his exploration seems to have matured him significantly, had a story to tell.

""Thanks to author Karl Baedeker's most helpful book, ""Northern Germany as far as the Bavarian and Austrian Frontiers; Handbook for Travellers"", I had no transit difficulties. I also had the good fortune to purchase a map of northern Germany from Wagner and Debes, Leipzig. I carried these with me throughout my trip and made copious notes in the style of a tourist lest they be examined. I've passed along both to Mr. Rice for his library.

""The Germans initially imported their railroad engineering and hardware from Britain but, I'm sorry to say, surpassed us after 1890. They are also ahead of the French, both for passenger and freight transport. Because of subsidization and their tax structure their lines run deep into agricultural areas. The total length of German railroad tracks has tripled since 1871, making it the largest rail network in Europe. The German State Railway Wagon Association (DSV) standardized the system in 1909.

""Under the guise of German road/rail comparison I inquired about their automobile industry. In this arena the tale is reversed. Germany pioneered in the field but I have discovered since my return that the UK might have more manufacturers than Germany has automobiles. In 1910 British vehicle production was 14,000 units. Overall, though, Germany has a thriving economy.

""In Kiel I learned the U boat, SM U-1 was commissioned by the Imperial German Navy in December of 1906. It had a double hull, was powered by a Körting kerosene engine and was armed with a single torpedo tube. The fifty percent larger SM U-2 has two torpedo tubes. They have increased their launching schedule from one a year to two in 1909. I have anticipated improvements and general specifications in my head and will transcribe them for you.""

""Because of its new role as Germany's main naval base, Kiel has increased in size from 18,770 in 1864 to about 200,000 in 1910. The Kiel tramway network which opened in 1881 is under constant expansion.

""The Germaniawerft shipyard is building or has built a number of battleships for the Kaiserliche Marine, including the SMS Posen, launched in December 1908, and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in May 1910. She was equipped with a main battery of twelve 28 cm guns in six twin turrets. Another battleship, SMS Prinzregent Luitpold has either recently been launched or is about to be launched. I have no more information on it. At least two more ships are planned, but the facility's main concentration is on U boats.""

In addition, Gill brought back several rolls of film and had mailed dozens of picture postcards along his way addressed to Aunt Renie at the Baker Street address.

""For the time being, Gill, you shall be assigned to Miss Adler advising her cadets.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 8 Sherlock, Miss Adler, Blocke, and I were gathered in the cottage. ""I have given you a copy of the report I will present in London. It states a summary of our collective impressions of what we found in Essen and from Krupp himself. In essence it paints a picture of a country dressing up for a party and, once attired, may feel an obligation to attend. They could talk themselves into war before they even know it.

""Certainly, Herr Krupp does not speak for all of the German upper class, but independent evidence collaborates our overview.

""They perceive the decline of the Ottoman Empire as a potential vacancy in a child's game of musical chairs. And they are all fattening their bottoms to take the seat.

""Those with proven expertise in one arena have come to believe that one, singular accomplishment has vouchsafed them with an expertise in all. From that vantage they talk with conviction on matters they know nothing about. They speak but do not listen. They are all swimming in currents too swift for them, but are too full of themselves to recognize the peril.

""It pains me to include in this report that the UK is not within the German field of vision. They presume we will not take sides. I say 'pains' because it will allow our own willfully myopic decision makers to reciprocate in kind.

""But perhaps they are correct. We are charged with observation and assessment not with policy making. The prevailing sentiment is that our government will reject German alliance overtures not because Germany poses a threat to Britain but, to the contrary, because she does not pose a threat.

""On the positive ledger there do exist vocal advocates for peaceful coexistence. Franz Ferdinand of Austria is one. We may hope he and his like-minded fellows prevail.""

.

Although the recent adventure remained in the minds of those involved, we did have other matters at hand.

So far, the only resident not accounted to you, dear reader, is Rice. Without hesitation I would commend him as the most diligent and most critical of our permanent staff. Rice is collator, referencer, and indexer. He looks for patterns, repetitions, anomalies. He brings order to chaos. 

At a time when Sherlock was dealing with individual cases it was more than sufficient for him alone to rely on his prodigious capacity to recall facts and infer connections. In the global milieu in which he now operates that would be impossible, not to mention, impractical. In addition, Sherlock was now part of a team of which I am one and Miss Adler might unanticipatingly become another. We needed access to the information coming into the colony to the same extent as Sherlock. Rice allows that facility.

It was he who brought to our attention the tensions between Serbia and Albania.

.

Our full compliment was seated at the center table of the mess. Sherlock had drawn out a rough map of Europe on the white tablecloth. He was moving around our mismatched pepper mills. At each shift one of our number or another would make an observation prompting a retreat to the earlier position or a movement of yet another piece. On occasion, Pencer, our radio operator would push or plunk down a copper from several he had in hand.

After half an hour of this exercise, young Gill, our indispensable factotum, arose and walked full around the table, his concentration on the map. He had been silent to this point and reticent in his usual way. Without a word he poured salt on one of the lines. Belgium had just fallen to Germany.

It took another hour for everyone to agree to the likelihood of this scenario. The next several days would be dedicated to planning where best to deploy our resources to monitor its validity. The irregulars would be on the move.

""Our friend Herr Krupp is owner of Germaniawerft in Kiel, which is Germany’s main warship builder. And we must not forget, the firm has built the first German U-boat. I believe we must discover if production at that plant is on the rise. A sea vessel is not something one orders today and takes delivery on tomorrow.""

Sherlock, Adler, and I gave him a list of what we thought might be needed and an encapsulated version of what we hoped to accomplish. He made a few additions, which Holmes seemed to understand, and subtractions, items which we could purchase along the way. Most of our requirements would be of German manufacture in case of discovery.

.

Sherlock relates the venture...

It was decided that everything but our persons would be crated at another location and taken across the Strait in a normal manner. On the first moonless night we would take Miss Adler's since-repaired row boat back across to the French coast. The following day we would purchase a cart to pick up the delivery and travel far enough inland where we could exchange it for a conveyance more suitable for speed and distance.

We made good time on the first day, reaching Ghent where we found comfortable and much appreciated lodgings. It was another two days before we reached Essen, our destination. The coach and team was left at a stable for boarding. A humble cart and horse was rented from another. At a third I purchased a horse and saddle. Miss Adler and Blocke took the cart and went in search of accommodations for a couple come to find employment at the Krupp works. After a short time I booked in at the same hotel as a businessman with appointments at the works. We planned to meet again for dinner to share notes.

Assuming the trappings of a land surveyor I rode off to Bredeney, home to the Villa Hügel and the Krupp family, built by Alfred Krupp in 1873 as a residence. It fit the owner of a company which had a near monopoly in heavy arms manufacture in Germany.

.

Gustav Krupp was born Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach in The Hague. He was a grandson of an American Civil War General Henry Bohlen. Through the encouragement of Emperor Kaiser William II he married Bertha Krupp in 1906. Bertha had inherited her family's company when her father committed suicide, but it was considered unthinkable for the Krupp empire to be headed by a woman. The Kaiser decreed that Gustav would be allowed to add the Krupp name to his own. Gustav became the company's chairman in 1909.

Miss Adler and Blocke went separate ways. Blocke recounted later that the Krupp company was a member and major funder of the Pan-German League which was mobilizing popular support in favor of raising Germany's standing army to 738,000 men. Miss Adler found a resurgence of nationalist sentiment wherever she went. Separately we visited taverns and meeting halls well into the night listening to gossip and directing the conversation when we might.

The following day our plan was much the same except my target was the factory. It was immense. The fumes belching from the chimney stacks formed a miasma covering the city and for miles around. Standing motionless one became filthy. A film of grit covered every surface. Breathing was an irritation.

I made drawings of the complex buildings and their functions, taking discrete photographs when I could. Toward nightfall I rode around the periphery noting the new excavations and guessed at their possible purpose from the adjacent structures. That evening was a repeat of the night before, going anywhere where people might congregate after a hard day's labor.

The morning of our third day we met to compare our findings. The general distillation from the gathered chatter was that the leaders were gearing up for something, but (1) those running the country knew what they were about and, anyway, it was most likely chest beating, beside, those fill-in-the-blank poltroons deserved what they'd get, (2) the prospect of conflict wouldn't affect them adversely because they had critical jobs.

Agricultural workers, coming to town to sell their produce or make purchases, felt the same way - someone else would do any fighting. The bosses and managers sang from the same hymnal and quoted from a plethora of newly installed motivational posters (propaganda).
As much effort as we had put in, it only reinforced what we already knew back at the colony four days ago.

""We're in the wrong place. Tomorrow we must move to Bredeney. You two take the cart. You will be hoping for jobs at the Villa and wish to learn if any openings are available and how the staff is treated. I'll arrive on horseback as an avid fisherman aching to try my luck at the nearby Baldeneysee reservoir and the Ruhr river. I'll want recommendations of the best spots, with a pint or two at the local ale house as reward.""

The results from those activities proved productive. ""The Krupps, separately and together, entertain and are entertained a good deal. Gustav goes to the plant everyday like clockwork at 10am. He meets with male colleagues for cards twice a month. By the best of fortune tomorrow night is one of those occasions. I have a plan.""

Before dawn the next morning the three of us were found uprooting a small tree along the route Krupp would take. We'd retrieved the carriage and Blocke was kitted out in the finest livery. Miss Adler walked up the road to a point where she could see us but not be seen from the opposite direction. At her signal we toppled the tree, Blocke made as though he was pulling it from the way of our carriage as I looked on with an aggrieved expression of irritation. Krupp's carriage pulled up and his driver, after conferring with his master, proceeded to help. Krupp exited and we acknowledged each other. ""Herr Krupp?"", I volunteered across the barrier, ""Allow me to introduce myself, I am Baron François Empain, brother to Édouard Empain of Belgium, you may be familiar with our family.""

""Most pleased to meet you, Baron. I regret I am in a hurry. I hope you enjoy our region."" With that he reentered his carriage and after a few moments a path was clear and he was carried away.

""Blighter!""

We delayed a while so not to reencounter Krupp as we returned to Essen and our rooms. 

.

After a long period of silence Miss Adler spoke up, ""Do either of you think we could learn anything if we put Herr Krupp under duress?"" Blocke and I cautiously agreed that was possible.

""Then let us kidnap the pompous ass. I don't see we have much to loose.""

.

It was agreed Blocke would conduct the interview in the jargon of an aristocrat. We would use the Adler technique of alluding to knowledge we did not possess and see where that led.

The scheme was to intercept the man as he left to join his friends for cards. That evening we stood in the middle of the lengthy drive which joined the villa to the public road. We had our faces masked but wore the attire of gentlemen. Miss Adler and I, flanking Blocke in the center, held lanterns to counter the appearance of threat.

Krupp's coach approached, slowed, and then stopped. Blocke spoke in an authoritative but not loud voice which somehow conveyed benevolent superiority. ""Herr Krupp, I wish private words with you concerning matters of importance.""

After assuring him, should the occasion arise, the German government would guarantee indemnity for his company should his exports to certain other countries be curtailed, he became a veritable font.

.

The cart had been returned. The horse resold. The loaded carriage was a short half-mile away. We attained it in ten minutes and headed west to trace our prior itinerary in reverse.

It was agreed Blocke would conduct the interview in the jargon of an aristocrat. We would use the Adler technique of alluding to knowledge we did not possess and see where that led.

The scheme was to intercept the man as he left to join his friends for cards. That evening we stood in the middle of the lengthy drive which joined the villa to the public road. We had our faces masked but wore the attire of gentlemen. Miss Adler and I, flanking Blocke in the center, held lanterns to counter the appearance of threat.

Krupp's coach approached, slowed, and then stopped. Blocke spoke in an authoritative but not loud voice which somehow conveyed benevolent superiority. ""Herr Krupp, I wish private words with you concerning matters of importance.""

After assuring him, should the occasion arise, the German government would guarantee indemnity for his company should his exports to certain other countries be curtailed, he became a veritable font.

The cart had been returned. The horse resold. The loaded carriage was a short half-mile away. We attained it in ten minutes and headed west to trace our prior itinerary in reverse.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 6 Two months passed before I returned again to the colony. I arrived late and retired early. Sherlock was breakfasting alone in the cottage when I joined him the next morning.

""You look absorbed, Sherlock.""

""For a while I have been gnawing on a very large bone... to be more accurate, since Miss Adler has proved herself so valuable to our efforts.

""We both agree she has a first rate mind, analytic and observant. She can be quick or deliberate depending on the demands. She is unquenchably curious. In addition, it pains me to admit, she many times sees dimensional aspects of a question you and I might miss. She is better at predicting what we might consider irrationality than we are. What I am being forced to accept is that she effectively integrates rational sentiment into her dissection of complex situations. I'm not comfortable with that concept, but she can justify her conclusions most logically.

""For decades I have spent much of my energies searching for facts, believing the path to correct interpretation was gained by separating and eliminating emotion from reason. Wishing for an investigation to go a certain way or in favor of certain people, those are impediments. Emotion is the mold on the bread, the bruise on the pear, the curdle in the milk.

""I know I am correct that emotion ofttimes corrupts rational thinking, but what if I've been wrong believing eradication is the correct nostrum. I often rely on intuition - I trust that inner influence to be pure, based upon a lifetime of unsullied deduction. What if that impulse is actually an unconscious amalgam? Would it not be ironic if the emotion of pride is blocking my bit of self interrogation? No, I'm not comfortable with this line of introspection.

""Do you know, Mycroft, Gill later informed me it took him three trips to fetch the boxes she brought back from London? He could not imagine how she got them all onto the poor horse. He suspects a stint as a balancing act circus performer in a prior life.

""The woman wants her cabin enlarged.""

.

I may have left the reader with an untrue impression that Sherlock was in permanent residence at the colony. In fact he maintained other abodes and identities and traveled a good deal. So it occurred that Sherlock was scheduled to leave the colony before my business was complete. That presented no problem because it was Blocke with whom I still needed to speak.

I found him in deep conversation with Miss Adler. They abruptly became silent at my approach. Being of a suspicious nature I asked what they were hatching. After a few awkward moments of hesitation the lady admitted they were probing the feasibility of a plan.

""We have become convinced there is one way to discover what lies behind the activities of the arms merchants and the financiers - go to them, specifically Gustav Krupp. How best to do that is what we've been working on.

""I'm not suggesting we knock on the Krupp door at Villa Hügel in Essen. We can, however, get a good sense of the man from where he lives and the attitudes of his workers toward him. Granted, we have had our reports, but they come from amateurs. Conversely, you must admit there are a scant few as adept at seeing beneath the surface than the two of us. Traveling as an itinerant couple we would draw no attention. There are no more invisible people than the working class.""

That gave me pause. I had to appreciate the merits of their proposal, but the perils were monumental. Not only would there be danger to themselves but to the work in the colony should they be detained - or worse. Their contributions here were critical. The biggest hurdle, though, would be Sherlock.

I asked sufficient questions to assure myself they had been thorough in their deliberations. I promised the couple I would broach the idea to Sherlock when next I saw him. That would be in London in two days time.

.

We lunched at a discrete restaurant near the Inner Temple and afterward walked along the Victoria Embankment. Trusting my brother to be at his most receptive I presented the Adler-Blocke proposition. He was quiet for such a time that I had to prompt him for a response.

He surprised me greatly. ""It has merit"", he said. ""What could be more nondescript than a husband, wife and, perhaps, his aged mother? That would justify a small wagon, empty of goods, but with space to hide sundry items which might prove helpful. It will require significant preparation, but its boldness appeals to me.""

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 5 It was agreed, all matters would best be continued on the following day.

At breakfast, again in the cottage, Miss Adler proceeded to tell her story.

""I have financial contacts all over Europe who would advise me of clandestine transfers of large sums of money. I would make it known to the involved parties that I knew of these payments and infer that I knew their purpose. The impression conveyed would appear to be a clumsy effort of extortion. In fact, the intent was to determine the identity and number of those thugs I expected would be dispatched to silence me. That illumination and further investigation many times would provide an answer to the original question or, at least, supply a large piece to the puzzle. Flight would signal to my targets that I was intimidated and would no longer be a threat.

""Most recently I was going through my usual performance when it began to look as though multiple streams might be merging to form a river. My loyal watchers informed me of three pursuers when I left Dresden. Rather than retiring, that number reached eight at Strassburg. It did not abate, but only swelled when I crossed into France. From that point I did not look back.

""Something very large is in the offing, and I have no idea what it is.""

.

Word had come back to the colony identifying Miss Adler's pursuers. All of those killed by the Shorncliffe troops were not street thugs or common ruffians but assassins.

""We are seeing similar activity."", remarked Sherlock. ""Aggressive  repression is definitely on the rise in parts of Europe. A veneer of 'the usual' masks a great deal of turbulence beneath the surface. Until we know more, though, let us discuss your immediate ambitions.""

""Allow me, please, to preface this 'interview', if you will, by apprising you that, although I was born in the United States, my parents were both British. Furthermore, I appreciate that the US and Great Britain, even when striving for the same ends, needs follow their separate paths. In short, I would feel no conflict offering what talents I have to your purpose. If my efforts bear fruit, and you wish to share them with the US, that would be your decision.


Sherlock and I decided a serendipitous opportunity to test Miss Adler's skills was presently at hand. We would send her to Baker Street to meet with our Strasbourg banker. The trip would allow her to replenish her wardrobe as well.

The following morning Sherlock set her down to undergo his deft hand at disguise. She would have liked to bridle, but had the sense not to. She had been provided with more appropriate travel attire, more banknotes than we thought necessary, and a letter of introduction to Mrs. Hudson. At 11am she was escorted through the clover field by Rice. They found the docile roan who was awarded a honey covered apple for his patience. Miss Adler mounted and was sent on her way.

She did not return the following day as we expected. Nor the next. Sherlock and I took alternate turns at being irritated and concerned. She was back on the third. Her tardiness, she explained, owed to her severing employment with her former masters, making her purchases, and a full day spent with the banker. Before we could hear what that entailed she allowed that Gill must be sent to retrieve some boxes left where she and the roan parted company.

The banker was not privy to those transactions already logged by Miss Adler, but he was aware of investments made by un-named third parties to armament manufacturers. The amounts coincided identically with those on her list. She provided us with a written report of the particulars.

The three of us discussed further lines of inquiry. That these were investments rather than purchases hinted at an expectation of increased future need rather than immediate demand. It needed to be determined at each of the companies - if there was a current expansion of the workforce, if additional raw materials were on order, and if new facilities were under construction. Other related industries, not on the banker's list, needed to be looked at.

Sherlock sent these questions to his German agents. He predicted answers would be back within a week. 

Returned:

The Krupp works in Essen, producers of steel, artillery, ammunition, and other armaments - new buildings under construction. No new hiring, no surplus materials.

DWM, Deutsche Waffen und Munitionsfabriken, manufacturers of the Luger pistol and the Mauser rifle. Both the munitions plant in Baden and the weapons plant in Berlin - new buildings under construction. No new hiring, no surplus materials. 

The casting of a wider net revealed the same story for three similar Austrian firms, Skoda, Schwarzlose, and Steyr Mannlicher.

.

I would report these findings to London in person. I was due back in any case. Sherlock affirmed he would concentrate greater resources to the matter. Miss Adler, who had yet to have a set role assigned to her, would be put together with Blocke our resident linguist and cultural expert. They would search for nuances and subtleties which might explain a prompt for broadened production. The two German firms, particularly, enjoyed a huge export trade. Perhaps they could see trouble brewing in regions we were missing. Perhaps they were looking to exploit a market which did not yet exist.

.

The universal reaction I obtained in London was that these activities were indeed cause for concern, but probably more for the neighboring countries than for us. Nothing from sources other than the colony gave my arguments additional weight.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 4 Our casual repast was relatively quick and quiet, everyone being past the point of exhaustion. Certainly no-one exhibited curiosity at the sudden introduction of a strange woman. The permanent colony staff knew not to discuss any matter with anyone who was not directly involved. 


Miss Adler was introduced to Pencer and informed that he could relay whatever messages she wished sent to London. She would not be suspicious that our isolated location was not on the phone - but of course we were - by multiple direct lines.


.


Consideration of distaff accommodations had never been part of the original planing. If truth be told, I would have thought the question negligible, and Sherlock would have thought it insurmountable. In the event, I would have been more correct than he. Miss Adler was shown to one of our guest cabins and left to her own devices.


.


Back at the cottage Sherlock and I discussed the startling turn of affairs. Adler was undeniably an overly bright individual and could not be immune from (a) wondering what we were about, and (b) coming to the correct answer, at least to the extent of compromising our cloak of non-existence. On the other hand it was not so much what we did, it was that we were very good at it. The big issue was she knew where we did it. Short of stuffing her into a poke and tossing her back into the sea our options were few.


Our quandary became more intense when Pencer provided us with the content of two messages which Adler requested be sent.


The first was a detailed list of large money transfers between individuals in various German cities and eight seemingly unrelated names. It was to go to a Mr. Hodges at the American embassy, the confidentiality to be verified and assured by Pencer. The second message was short and in code, same recipient.


Sherlock and I agreed the first message would be sent through a London intermediary. I knew Hodges as an upper level official. We would decide on the second when we had better insight. 


The lad, Gill, was the nearest to Miss Adler's size. He was instructed to provide for her trousers, a tunic, and a pair of light slippers, and to advise her if she left her clothes and shoes outside her door they would be cleaned and returned. They would, of course, be examined by Sherlock and myself first. Her shoes might be keep slightly longer. She was also invited to dine with the Holmes brothers at the cottage that evening.


Not long after those arrangements were completed a response from the lady's first message came back. It warned that those who had orchestrated her pursuit across Europe were not deterred by the past night's failure. They remained resolute that she be captured or killed. She was instructed to go to ground - if safe, not to move.


That answer had not as yet been delivered to the lady and would not be for at least another day since she was not to know we had phone and wireless telegraphy. Should anyone ever question the authenticity of magic I can only cite what women are capable of with their toilet. Miss Adler had been furnished with soap, a flannel, a pitcher of warm water, and a wash bowl - the same as to everyone one else in the colony. What incantation she might have employed, or potion she might have drawn from the air, I'm sure I'll never know. What I do know is that when she arrived at the cottage she was a total transformation from the coarse canvas of her earlier self into conservatory velvet.


Hauser's talents proved equal to the company.


""Miss Adler"", I began when we had settled into our meal, ""I hope you will forgive my directness, but what are your immediate plans? That is not to say your presence is unwelcome, but you have invaded a male preserve. We are not really prepared for guests.""


""Please allow me to be direct - perhaps even more direct"", she answered. ""I have come to realize this is a delicate preserve as well, and that my intrusion has created a much greater inconvenience than simply disturbing a reclusive gentleman's contemplations. You have my very sincerest regrets and I do understand those regrets cannot change the unchangeable.""


""Before we travel down that path,"" interrupted Sherlock, ""I wish to counter direct with blunt. Earlier today you wrote a message in code. Would you explain the nature of that message?""


""That communiqué is meant for my younger brother. He is, as you probably already know I am, a spy. For the safety of both of us we do not correspond directly or share the particulars of our individual activities."" Admitting this she looked directly at me.


""The message is only to assure him I am safe and well since he is no doubt aware of my current jeopardy. My career is finished with this latest mission. I am too well known, under too many names and disguises, in too many countries. I'm also a bit too old to be rowing across the Straits of Dover in the middle of the night and sleeping in trees. I can only hope my information proves worth the sacrifice.""


""Would you be so kind as to write for me the exact text uncoded?, asked Sherlock.


She obliged and I handed to Sherlock what had been supplied by Pencer. He compared the two side by side for a few minutes then nodded to me. After another pause he nodded again and I retrieved from the same pocket the response which had come in answer to her first message.


""How...? Her mouth opened and forgot to close. ""Oh my.""


""Miss Adler"", I said, ""would you consider an alternative line of employ for a different firm?"" Sherlock looked at the ceiling.

","Our casual repast was relatively quick and quiet, everyone being past the point of exhaustion. Certainly no-one exhibited curiosity at the sudden introduction of a strange woman. The permanent colony staff knew not to discuss any matter with anyone who was not directly involved. 


Miss Adler was introduced to Pencer and informed that he could relay whatever messages she wished sent to London. She would not be suspicious that our isolated location was not on the phone - but of course we were - by multiple direct lines.


.


Consideration of distaff accommodations had never been part of the original planing. If truth be told, I would have thought the question negligible, and Sherlock would have thought it insurmountable. In the event, I would have been more correct than he. Miss Adler was shown to one of our guest cabins and left to her own devices.


.


Back at the cottage Sherlock and I discussed the startling turn of affairs. Adler was undeniably an overly bright individual and could not be immune from (a) wondering what we were about, and (b) coming to the correct answer, at least to the extent of compromising our cloak of non-existence. On the other hand it was not so much what we did, it was that we were very good at it. The big issue was she knew where we did it. Short of stuffing her into a poke and tossing her back into the sea our options were few.


Our quandary became more intense when Pencer provided us with the content of two messages which Adler requested be sent.


The first was a detailed list of large money transfers between individuals in various German cities and eight seemingly unrelated names. It was to go to a Mr. Hodges at the American embassy, the confidentiality to be verified and assured by Pencer. The second message was short and in code, same recipient.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 3 The three of us repaired to the cottage from whence I went off to the radio building. I instructed young Gill to bring in the others and to ask Hauser if he was up to creating something to assuage the hunger of eight plus one. Gill solved the first by ringing the camp's dinner bell. The second he proceeded to aid by lighting the stove and putting water to boil.

The atmosphere at the cottage was strained at best. Both occupants had done what they could to undo the damage inflicted by a night in the rain. For all he was worth Sherlock was at sea about what to do with Miss Adler - or how to answer the most immediate question... was she a threat to the colony? I felt it incumbent upon myself to put him at ease, at least to the best I was able.
.
I was unaware of Sherlock's encounter with Irene Adler prior to it being released to the public by Dr. Watson. I confess the account gave me cause to smile at the time because I knew of her through my professional capacity. She had been diplomatically introduced to my office by American officials several years before. I had never made her acquaintance and she, therefore, would have realized no connection between the brothers Holmes. She probably gave Sherlock no particular thought other than as an agent in the employ of the King of Bohemia. However, there must have been some attraction prompting her to speak to him in the street - or, possibly, she simply couldn't resist the jape.

Through inquiries I learned the hasty marriage to the barrister Godfrey Norton had been arranged to provide Miss Adler travel with another passport under a new identity. Her New Jersey birthplace 'inadvertently' became Jersey. 

The King's liaison with Adler was more bravado and braggadocio than actual fact. He enjoyed having the young woman on his arm and in the lascivious speculation of his male circle. His concern for his reputation was valid. But he, not she, was the prompt of those possible stains.

He presumed Adler's quick marriage and departure from England was evidence of her intimidation by him. In actuality she had received instructions from her American masters to hasten to Rome. They felt need to understand the ramifications of the 'Prisoners of the Vatican' issue.

The title-name on her dossier with my office was 'eagle' which is the English translation for the German, adler. Many times her whereabouts became unknown to us, but some person who could have been her would draw attention in a foreign capitol, busy port, or major city. Many times information would be passed along from our American brethren which might have originated from a source with her credentials. She was never removed from our books but, for what we knew, she could have died on numerous occasions or been moldering in a dank cell somewhere. Dr. Watson believed her deceased.

Norton had his nuptials to Adler annulled and celebrated a more customary wedding 17 months later to the daughter of a judge. He is now himself a judge - with an occasional brief from Whitehall. I informed the pair that we could expect to be fed shortly, then I put my attention to our guest. ""Miss Adler, you may not know me but please believe I know much about you."" Sherlock's gaze fell on me. ""I need to know several things from you. The first is, are you here by chance or by choice?""

""More choice than chance."", she admitted. ""I am privy to some particularly delicate information which I must pass along to US officials. I had refused to believe the announcement of Sherlock Holmes' retirement. I trusted if I found him he could provide help. Examining the coastal maps I reasoned if I were looking for a place where no-one would think to find me it would be in this general region. Should that have proved wrong I could still make my way to the Shorncliffe Camp although that is where my pursuers expected me to be heading. In fact that is how I gained my advantage. They thought I'd cross the Strait at Calais, but I chose Wissant instead. It was still very close.

""I am hesitant to interrupt your very valid questions, but I have one for you Mr. Holmes, do you have a way to forward my information to London? It is important.""

""I believe we can help you solve that problem, Miss Adler."" I replied. At that moment the mess bell rang for its usual purpose.

1,"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 2 Sherlock's palate had never been refined. Mrs. Hudson kept the London household nourished and well fed, but she had her limitations. Concern for Sherlock and, perhaps, more for myself - even acknowleging my visits would be sporadic - I did raise a voice in the initial colony planning. I argued for a chef from London rather than a mess cook from Shorncliffe. A compromise was reached on a Swiss parolee from the Pentonville Prison. He turned out to be a good fit. He knew cuisine, could handle large numbers when required, and was not hesitant when there were needs elsewhere. Currently there were only six individuals in the colony, not counting ourselves,  so I looked forward to our menu.

Sherlock and I dined privately that evening. His cottage was basically one large room with a loft area toward the rear which provided sleeping quarters to the left and right, accessed and separated by a center stair-ladder arrangement. The former occupants had been a farmer and wife with two children. They left their furnishings which were quite comfortable, albeit modest. Somewhat spoiling the effect, however, were utilitarian bookshelves against every available wall space. These were obviously quartermaster issue.

We enjoyed a nicely prepared dinner. Hauser, the cook, insisted on a vegetable garden and tended it himself. After the server retired we relaxed, I with my cigar and Sherlock with his pipe. Our conversation, as was usual, was filled with non-sequiturs, or what would seem so to an outsider - a little past, present, and obscure.

There was a small fire in the hearth and a nice brandy in hand. A body could doze off without giving it a thought. The ambient mellowness, though, was of a sudden disturbed by a sharp rap on the door. Upon admittance the young cadet, Gill - but they all looked young these days - rushed to Sherlock with a message.

After a moment, Sherlock looked up from what was written and barked at the lad, ""Have everyone gather in the mess immediately and tell Wallace to initiate full alert procedures.""

It seemed only seconds before Sherlock had doused all but minimum light and handed to me a Webley revolver, putting another in his own pocket. ""It appears, Mycroft, we may be under siege very shortly.""

As we exited the cottage I noticed whatever moon there had been prior to our supper was now obscured by ominous black clouds. I could not predict if that would be in our favor or not.

Tension pervaded the mess when we got there. It was not reduced by the dim glow from a single lamp set on the floor in a corner of the room. Following Sherlock's lead we all sat upon the floor. We must have presented an eerie picture. The lamplight reflected off Rice's glasses and illumined Wallace's hair and beard. Everyone was armed as we were.

Sherlock addressed us, ""It is being reported that several small boats have been taken at gunpoint by a dozen men on the opposite French shore. Troops from Shorncliffe have been assigned to craft and are patrolling the Strait as I speak. It is unknown the target or purpose of these men. It is, however, up to us to protect the colony from detection at all costs.""

At this point the reader should be aware of our immediate topography to understand what this protection might entail. Along our bit of coast, unlike the forbidding Dover cliffs or the inviting beach at Folkestone, we have shingle, rock, and quite quickly a rise of forest. The colony is less than half a mile from water's edge. By design it has been 'helped' to look unappealing and, at the same time, unexciting.

Wallace and Blocke were directed to scout to the south. Rice and Hauser would go north while Sherlock and I would cover the center. The north and south pairs each would take a hound. Pencer, the radio operator, and Gill, the dogsbody lad, would stay behind to monitor for new developments and report to each party if needs be. 

Sherlock spoke gravely, ""Given the critical nature of our work and the high likelihood that we might be numerically and tactically disadvantaged if we are the intended objective, everyone is instructed to shoot anything coming from the sea - anything - without compunction or hesitation.""

A password and response were issued so we would not fire upon each other, and we then proceeded into a beginning drizzle which promised to get worse. It was well past midnight.

.

As we made our cautious way to the shore we could hear a smattering of shots coming from out in the Strait. We could make out no muzzle flashes, but visibility was extremely limited. Turning north at water's edge we began looking for any evidence of human encroachment. Darkness, combined with the now steady rain, made for slow going. We still heard intermittent gunfire. About 250 yards along Sherlock stopped suddenly with a hand on my sleeve. He'd sensed something which I had not. Pausing for a full minute he ventured the password. A correct answer came back.

Mr. Rice emerged from the dark and reported nothing untoward. It was agreed we would sweep our respective patches at least until dawn.

Sherlock and I meticulously retraced our steps. A mere 20 yards past our initial entry place we spied an ominous shadow just at the water's edge. Cautiously we advanced until we could discern that it was a small rowing boat - empty, but with a gash in its bottom.

""What do you make of that?"", I quietly asked.

I received no answer as Sherlock dropped to his knees in the shale. He plied his signature absorption and determination for a good ten minutes. He spent another ten where the trees began. But his face betrayed frustration, his eyes said it all. Nothing was there to be found. If ever there had been it was all washed away with the downpour and an incoming tide.

We stood for a bit in silence and conjecture, the still beating rain washing the blood and grit from my brother's injured hands. At last he whispered, ""Mycroft, you go back to the colony and see what news has come to us. It's been a while since we've heard any shooting. I'll continue south and see if there is anything else to discover. We'll meet back here in half an hour.""

We went our ways, and I applied a sharp eye for anything that might have survived the elements on my way to the radio building. When I got close I saw the lights were full on. That was a surprise.

Pencer was more than pleased to inform me the soldiers had accounted for all the stolen craft and counted out all of the attackers. Five were shot and killed, seven were drowned. What they couldn't provide, though, was a reason. A bunch of pernicious foreigners, the worse for drink and gone on rampage?

I hastened back to rendezvous with Sherlock and kept going past the damaged boat. It was just coming on to dawn and I could see him about 30 yards further along. We met half way and I repeated the military's report. We discussed the damaged boat, that the oars were missing, and that it could have broken loose from anywhere and have simply been cast up by the tide. Certainly rowing across the Strait seemed a desperate thing for anyone to consider. We returned to it and Sherlock insisted on a further look around.

Within two minutes he beckoned me into the nearby wood. He signaled for quiet and removed the pistol from his pocket. All in the same instant a voice came to us, ""Good morning Mr. Sherlock Holmes"", Holmes raised his gun, and then a knee seemed to give way. He nearly fell. He regained himself, and in that moment the scruffiest looking drowned rat of an individual tumbled from the nearest tree.

""Miss Adler, so nice of you to drop in."" said Sherlock. His voice sounded somewhat shaky, but I was quite shaken myself.

The rat became upright and Sherlock said, ""Miss Adler, please allow me to introduce to you my brother, Mycroft. Mycroft, this is Miss Irene Adler.""

""The pleasure is most assuredly mine."" chimed our apparition. 

Sherlock put the Webley back into his pocket - and the rain stopped.

Aylesford is a large village on the River Medway, accessed via a medieval five-arched bridge. There has been a settlement on this spot since Neolithic times. Aylesford Priory was founded in 1242. 

As a youth I was taught Latin by an instructor who was brought up in a priory. One day he told a story about a young priest who asked his superior if it would be acceptable if he smoked while he prayed. The superior dismissed the monk, saying it would not, that the supplicant should dedicate his attention entirely to God when praying. Some time passed, and the priest again approached his superior asking if it would be accept able if he prayed while he smoked. The superior praised his devotion.

Maidstone has seen settlement by the Romans and the Normans and was the site of pivotal moments in English history such as the Peasants' Revolt and the Second Civil War.

Madüogüiso, in the early British tongue, came to be called Madis, the river being called Madus. The Saxons afterwards called it Medwegston (Medway's town), by contraction in the Domesday Book, Meddestane, and now, Maidstone.

Lenham is a market village and civil parish in Kent situated on the southern edge of the North Downs. Technically the fact that Lenham is allowed a market makes it a town but the community have always desired to maintain its village status.

Mary Honywood was born in Lenham in 1527 and died there in 1620. The woman had eighteen children and lived to see 367 of her descendants.

Ashford began as a Saxon village. By the early 13th century it had grown into a small market town. In 1800 it had a population of a little over two thousand. The railway reached Ashford in 1842 and by 1900 the population reached nearly thirteen thousand.

The Territorial Army had established a volunteer reserve unit in Ashford in 1910. Men were enlisted into the Force by a county association and as part of a specific corps. Periods of initial service were not to exceed four years, but could be extended for a further four years at the end of the first duty. A member of the Force could buy his discharge before the end of his term by giving three months notice and paying a sum of up to five pounds, except in times of embodiment for service.

If the Force was called out for permanent service when the time for a man's discharge came due, he could be required to prolong his service by up to twelve months.

I was traveling southeast from London to Hythe on the Great Eastern Railway through some of the country's most historic landmarks.

I have a theory - actually it is only theoretical in that I ascribe what I experience to be attributable to others - not the specifics certainly, but the generalities. My theory is that certain settings are conducive to certain types of thought. For instance, I am most productive analyzing the relationship of numbers when I am sitting upright at a desk. Conversely, if I am drafting the notes of an argument to be presented to reluctant listeners, I am most successful doing so while coincidentally tossing bread to geese in a park. On a train I feel comfortable letting my mind chug along wherever it wishes to go.

The aforementioned is only to explain that while traveling by rail I enjoy the passing scenery. Sometimes I enjoy the other passengers, although when I wish solitude in the compartment I employ a 'face' which scares children and warns off adults. I enjoy the smoothly rocking motion. I enjoy the repetitious clicky-clack. All are conducive to thought - my thought, at any rate - when I'm favorable to allowing the mental process to preclude the mental purpose.

.

I gathered myself knowing the next stop would be the end of the line and my destination. Hythe is a pleasant town with two and three story buildings well tended and clean. It is just large enough that a non resident does not stand out or draw attention.

.

A dozen dignitaries and staff had been in attendance when the Prince of Wales visited Hythe in 1881 for a ceremony at the Royal Military Canal. On this occasion of my arrival there was no heralding, but there was a carriage waiting which took me the several miles to a small farm from whence horseback would be my transport.

The driver became stableman and saddled a roan, provided a step so I might easily get seated, and issued instructions, which I knew in advance, were not to control the reins. He slapped the horse's rump and my mount and I started off at a leisurely pace.

Our trek would have seemed most erratic to any observer. But of course there would be no such observer. Nor would there be any evidence of my trek. The horse's hooves were 'socked' with raw hide and left no trail. Furthermore, as my equine companion and I knew well, our narrow path was the only way through a mile deep swath of gorse and bog. The ground was not as even as first seemed which dictated a measured pace. A quicker gait and any misstep might turn annoyance into alarm. A stumble could prove more than unfortunate.

.

It was an hour before we stopped by a large rock which, through designed happenstance, allowed a convenient disembarkation aid. I unloosed a roll of fabric attached to the saddle, turned my beast around, slapped him as the groom had done, and sent him back the way we'd come.

.

I, in turn, proceeded a short way, over a short rise. Ahead of me presented a complete change of scenery. Bucolic was the only word. All before was a field of clover - and auditory bedlam. The innocent looking vista was aswarm with bees signaling their displeasure at my imminent trespass. At that point I halted, unrolled my burden, and cloaked myself from head to foot in flimsy gauze. Thus protected, and I suspect with the appearance of some fearsome wraith, I invaded their domain.

A quarter mile along brought me past a number of constructed hives and soon enough thereafter into relative quiet. I removed my costume but that brief respite too was broken by a pair of intent bloodhounds come to affirm my credentials.

I passed muster aided by their master's command. ""Mycroft. I'm so pleased you've come.""

.

We walked toward what a number of months ago had been a solitary, modest cottage and, noticing various annexes and outbuildings, I asked their purpose.

""There are more deterrents here than bees and bogs to discourage overland visitors, but people flit in and out from our coastal access with some frequency so we needed extra billets. In addition, I now have separate laboratories and, of course, the coordinating facility has spread like bramble. Wireless telegraphy occupies a building of its own. What you may not recognize are a few crows nests and antennae hidden in the tallest trees and there is even a carrier pigeon coop."" His enthusiasm was palpable and contagious.

.

The facility, when labor, materials, and equipment were required, relied on discrete import by night from the Shorncliffe Military Camp not far up the Strait of Dover coast. The 'colony', as it has been dubbed, is unknown to all but a very few, and its funding is buried in many budgets. The purpose is secret. The location, even more so.

.

Sherlock engaged an ever expanding web of eyes and ears throughout the European continent and they all spoke back to this hub. Every method of conveying information from one place to another, particularly in a covert fashion, was available to, and in use by, his multinational 'irregulars'.

My brother's role was to discover what malignant forces might be currently at work on the continent. My contribution, as it had been throughout my government service, was to ascertain in what way and why those forces might impact His Majesty's Realm. Together we were tasked to adjudge how to defuse and/or deflect those forces.

If an analogy might be drawn, Sherlock functioned as microscope to my telescope, or magnifying glass to my wide lens.

.

It had been a year since I last had met with my brother. But, in that span, we were probably more in contact than at any other period of our adult life. Ironically, the cause was a joined  preoccupation on matters far from home.

Thoughts of home prompted us into a discussion of life at Baker Street. With his departure Holmes had made arrangements that Mrs. Hudson would not require taking in borders to maintain living in her own home. The good woman, on the other hand, knew Sherlock too well to be fooled by his fabrication of retirement. To tend bees, no less - ""Pshaw!"" She would allow that Dr. Watson might be content with the leisure to spoil his grandchildren, but the foremost detective in the world - ""Never!""

.

Under nagging, unrelenting interrogation, Sherlock was forced to confess that he would elsewhere be occupied with 'government' work. Having hovered on the periphery for so many years Mrs. Hudson demanded to be 'dealt in'. Hence, 221A ground floor, replaced 221B first floor, as a periodic stopping place for myself and occasional discrete guests who would lodge above for short durations. At present a raw ore analyst from Barcelona and a senior bank official from Strasbourg enjoyed the hospitality of the Baker Street manse.

* The Hound of the Baskervilles (serialised 1901–1902 in The Strand)
* The Valley of Fear (serialised 1914–1915 in The Strand)

Short story collections

The short stories, originally published in magazines, were later collected in five anthologies:

* The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (stories published 1891–1892 in The Strand)
* The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (stories published 1892–1893 in The Strand as further episodes of the Adventures)

1,"The original novels, the complete canon audiobook set, OTR radio broadcasts, BBC radio series, 2009 film, or the new Sherlock BBC series - where to begin? I was recently bitten by the detective bug so I purchased the first single-volume edition of the Annotated Sherlock Holmes (a 10 pound mammoth beast of a book!), and secured a handsome mahogany bookcase to protect it from shelf-wear.  
  
In the days that followed I picked up the complete canon audiobook collection, unabridged, read by John Telfer.
  
Always the completist, I also sprang for the Old Time Radio New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone which were broadcast between 1938-1964.  220 shows have survived, and 53 are currently known to be in circulation.
  
Next I snatched up the 64 CD 48 hr box set of the BBC dramatizations of all 56 of the Sherlock Holmes stories.
  
I'm not big on cinema so I have yet to see the 2009 film or the BBC television series (though I hear it's wonderful stuff and Moffat hasn't failed me yet.)
  
Thus far I've listened to 6 of the audiobook stories and enjoyed them very much.  Telfer does an excellent job voicing each of the characters.
  
My question to r/sherlockholmes is this:  
  
Are there particular stories/episodes from the series and books above which you recommend as essential reading/listening?  I've read that the earlier Rathbone broadcasts are better than the shows that came later.  
  
I'm sitting on 140 hours of audio material and over 1500 pages of annotated tales... where do I begin?  And is there anything important that I am missing?
  
THANK you for any/all recommendations!","I was recently bitten by the detective bug so I purchased the first single-volume edition of the Annotated Sherlock Holmes (a 10 pound mammoth beast of a book!), and secured a handsome mahogany bookcase to protect it from shelf-wear.
