SherlockHolmes,"""1. Knowledge of Literature: Nil."
SherlockHolmes,"""And what do you conclude from that, Watson?"""
SherlockHolmes,"""I see millions of stars, Holmes,"" says Watson."
SherlockHolmes,"""Watson, you idiot! Someone has stolen our tent!”"
SherlockHolmes,"“A man always finds it hard to realize that he may have finally lost a woman's love, however badly he may have treated her.”"
SherlockHolmes,“Crime is common. Logic is rare. Therefore it is upon the logic rather than upon the crime that you should dwell.”
SherlockHolmes,“Do you remember what Darwin says about music? He claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at. Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it. There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.'
SherlockHolmes,“Dr. Watson's summary list of Sherlock Holmes's strengths and weaknesses:
SherlockHolmes,"“Education never ends, Watson. It is a series of lessons, with the greatest for the last.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Excellent!"" I cried. ""Elementary,"" said he.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“From the first day I met her, she was the only woman to me. Every day of that voyage I loved her more, and many a time since have I kneeled down in the darkness of the night watch and kissed the deck of that ship because I knew her dear feet had trod it. She was never engaged to me. She treated me as fairly as ever a woman treated a man. I have no complaint to make. It was all love on my side, and all good comradeship and friendship on hers. When we parted she was a free woman, but I could never again be a free man.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Holmes and Watson are on a camping trip. In the middle of the night Holmes wakes up and gives Dr. Watson a nudge. ""Watson"" he says, ""look up in the sky and tell me what you see."""
SherlockHolmes,"“How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?”"
SherlockHolmes,"“How sweet the morning air is! See how that one little cloud floats like a pink feather from some gigantic flamingo. Now the red rim of the sun pushes itself over the London cloud-bank. It shines on a good many folk, but on none, I dare bet, who are on a stranger errand than you and I. How small we feel with our petty ambitions and strivings in the presence of the great elemental forces of Nature!”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I am a brain, Watson. The rest of me is a mere appendix.”"
SherlockHolmes,“I am somewhat exhausted; I wonder how a battery feels when it pours electricity into a non-conductor?”
SherlockHolmes,“I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather.”
SherlockHolmes,"“I imagine John Watson thinks love’s a mystery to me, but the chemistry is incredibly simple and very destructive. When we first met, you told me that a disguise is always a self portrait, how true of you, the combination to your safe – your measurements. But this is far more intimate. This is your heart, and you should never let it rule your head. You could have chosen any random number and walked out of here today with everything you worked for. But you just couldn’t resist it, could you? I’ve always assumed that love is a dangerous disadvantage. Thank you for the final proof.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I'm not a psychopath, I'm a high-functioning sociopath. Do your research.”"
SherlockHolmes,“Is there any point to which you would wish to draw my attention?'
SherlockHolmes,"“It may be that you are not yourself luminous, but that you are a conductor of light. Some people without possessing genius have a remarkable power of stimulating it.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.”"
SherlockHolmes,“Mediocrity knows nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius.”
SherlockHolmes,"“My mind,"" he said, ""rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense then with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.”"
SherlockHolmes,“My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people do not know.”
SherlockHolmes,“No man burdens his mind with small matters unless he has some very good reason for doing so.”
SherlockHolmes,"“Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you know not whether for good or ill.”"
SherlockHolmes,“The game is afoot.”
SherlockHolmes,"“There is nothing more to be said or to be done tonight, so hand me over my violin and let us try to forget for half an hour the miserable weather and the still more miserable ways of our fellowmen.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“To a great mind, nothing is little,' remarked Holmes, sententiously.”"
SherlockHolmes,“What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence. The question is what can you make people believe you have done.”
SherlockHolmes,"“You have a grand gift for silence, Watson. It makes you quite invaluable as a companion.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“You're not hurt, Watson? For God's sake, say that you are not hurt!"""

SherlockHolmes,"It was worth a wound -- it was worth many wounds -- to know the depth of loyalty and love which lay behind that cold mask. The clear, hard eyes were dimmed for a moment, and the firm lips were shaking. For the one and only time I caught a glimpse of a great heart as well as of a great brain. All my years of humble but single-minded service culminated in that moment of revelation.”"
SherlockHolmes,"One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,' he answered.”"
SherlockHolmes,"That was the curious incident,' remarked Sherlock Holmes.”"
SherlockHolmes,"That's a rather broad idea,' I remarked."
SherlockHolmes,The dog did nothing in the night-time.'
SherlockHolmes,To the curious incident of the dog in the night-time.'
SherlockHolmes,"Watson thinks for a moment. ""Well,"" he says, ""astronomically, it tells me that there are millions of galaxies and potentially billions of planets. Astrologically, I observe that Saturn is in Leo. Horologically, I deduce that the time is approximately a quarter past three. Meterologically, I suspect that we will have a beautiful day tomorrow. Theologically, I see that God is all-powerful, and we are small and insignficant. Uh, what does it tell you, Holmes?"""
SherlockHolmes,"‘Ah, that’s lucky,’ he said, and not another word would he utter that night.”"
SherlockHolmes,"‘Not in the least,’ I answered in astonishment."
SherlockHolmes,"""On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door on the inside,"" said Holmes.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“...I cannot live without brain-work. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the dun-colored houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material? What is the use of having powers, doctor, when one has no field upon which to exert them? Crime is commonplace, existence is commonplace, and no qualities save those which are commonplace have any function upon earth.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Am dining at Goldini's Restaurant, Gloucester Road, Kensington. Please come at once and join me there. Bring with you a jemmy, a dark lantern, a chisel, and a revolver. S. H."" It was a nice equipment for a respectable citizen to carry through the dim, fog-draped streets.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a Freemason, that he has been in China, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, I can deduce nothing else.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Do you know, Watson,"" said he, ""that it is one of the curses of a mind with a turn like mine that I must look at everything with reference to my own special subject. You look at these scattered houses, and you are impressed by their beauty. I look at them, and the only thought which comes to me is a feeling of their isolation and of the impunity with which crime may be committed there.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Good old Watson! You are the one fixed point in a changing age. There's an east wind coming all the same, such a wind as never blew on England yet. It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it's God's own wind none the less, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“How often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth?”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I am not the law, but I represent justice so far as my feeble powers go.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I cannot live without brainwork. What else is there to live for? Stand at the window here. Was ever such a dreary, dismal, unprofitable world? See how the yellow fog swirls down the street and drifts across the duncoloured houses. What could be more hopelessly prosaic and material?”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of daily life.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I love Sherlock Holmes. I've got all his books, leather-bound. What I thought was great about Sherlock Holmes was that not only was he a supersleuth, he was also a hard worker. Not only did he go out and solve the crimes, he came home and wrote it all down. Fantastic. That's why I admire him.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I mean, imagine how some unfortunate Master Criminal would feel, on coming down to do a murder at the old Grange, if he found that not only was Sherlock Holmes putting in the weekend there, but Hercule Poirot, as well."" ~ Bertram ""Bertie"" Wooster”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I say, Watson,’ he whispered, ‘would you be afraid to sleep in the same room as a lunatic, a man with softening of the brain, an idiot whose mind has lost its grip?’"
SherlockHolmes,"“I should be very much obliged if you would slip your revolver into your pocket. An Eley's No. 2 is an excellent argument with gentlemen who can twist steel pokers into knots. That and a tooth-brush are, I think, all that we need.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I wanted to end the world, but I'll settle for ending yours.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I was fifteen when I first met Sherlock Holmes, fifteen years old with my nose in a book as I walked the Sussex Downs, and nearly stepped on him. In my defense I must say it was an engrossing book, and it was very rare to come across another person in that particular part of the world in that war year of 1915.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“It is my belief, Watson, founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the smiling and beautiful countryside.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“It is only goodness which gives extras, and so I say again that we have much to hope from the flowers.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“My mind rebels at stagnation, give me problems, give me work!”"
SherlockHolmes,“No ghosts need apply.
SherlockHolmes,"“No: I am not tired. I have a curious constitution. I never remember feeling tired by work, though idleness exhausts me completely."" ~ Sherlock Holmes”"
SherlockHolmes,“Not that Dr Watson wasn't benign - he was one of the best souls in the Empire - but a man didn't get to be her uncle's right-hand man without a good uppercut and the stamina of a draft horse.”
SherlockHolmes,“She wondered how Dr. Watson - a clever man in his own right - had lasted so many years without bashing his roommate over the head out of sheer frustration.”
SherlockHolmes,“Show Holmes a drop of water and he would deduce the existence of the Atlantic. Show it to me and I would look for a tap. That was the difference between us.”
SherlockHolmes,"“The man might have died in a fit; but then the jewels are missing,"" mused the Inspector, ""Ha! I have a theory. These flashes come upon me at times... What do you think of this, Holmes? Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off the treasure! How's that?"""
SherlockHolmes,"“There are many men in London, you know, who, some from shyness, some from misanthropy, have no wish for the company of their fellows. Yet they are not averse to comfortable chairs and the latest periodicals. It is for the convenience of these that the Diogenes Club was started, and it now contains the most unsociable and unclubbable men in town. No member is permitted to take the least notice of any other one. Save in the Stranger's Room, no talking is, under any circumstances, allowed, and three offenses, if brought to the notice of the committee, render the talker liable to expulsion. My brother was one of the founders, and I have myself found it a very soothing atmosphere.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,"" he remarked with a smile. ""It's a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive.”"
SherlockHolmes,“You know my method. It is founded upon the observation of trifles.”
SherlockHolmes,“You know my methods. Apply them.”
SherlockHolmes,“Your life is not your own. Keep your hands off it.”
SherlockHolmes,"""Do you not find it interesting?"""
SherlockHolmes,"""Light-houses, my boy! Beacons of the future! Capsules with hundreds of bright little seeds in each, out of which will spring the wiser, better England of the future.”"
SherlockHolmes,"""Look at those big, isolated clumps of buildings rising up above the slates, like brick islands in a lead-coloured sea."""
SherlockHolmes,"""The board-schools."""
SherlockHolmes,"""To a collector of fairy-tales.”"
SherlockHolmes,"""Well?"" said he."
SherlockHolmes,"“...Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer- excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained observer to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Her cuisine is limited but she has as good an idea of breakfast as a Scotchwoman."""
SherlockHolmes,"“Holmes took up the stone and held it against the light. ""It's a bonny thing,"" said he. ""Just see how it glints and sparkles. Of course it is a nucleus and focus of crime. Every good stone is. They are the devil's pet baits. In the larger and older jewels every facet may stand for a bloody deed. This stone is not yet twenty years old. It was found in the banks of the Amoy River in soutern China and is remarkable in having every characteristic of the carbuncle, save that it is blue in shade instead of ruby red. In spite of its youth, it has already a sinister history. There have been two murders, a vitriol-throwing, a suicide, and several robberies brought about for the sake of this forty-grain weight of crystallised charcoal. Who would think that so pretty a toy would be a purveyor to the gallows and the prison?”"
SherlockHolmes,“I am lost without my Boswell.
SherlockHolmes,"“I could not rest, Watson, I could not sit quiet in my chair, if I thought that such a man as Professor Moriarty were walking the streets of London unchallenged.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I have always held, too, that pistol practice should be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Homes, in one of his queer humours, would sit in an armchair with his hair-trigger and a hundred Boxer cartridges and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with a patriotic V.R. done in bullet pocks, I felt strongly that neither the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.”"
SherlockHolmes,“I have taken to living by my wits.”
SherlockHolmes,"“I must apologize for calling so late,"" said he, ""and I must further beg you to be so unconventional as to allow me to leave your house presently by scrambling over your back garden wall.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I must thank you,' said Sherlock Holmes, 'for calling my attention to a case which certainly presents some features of interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was exceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting English cases.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I undid the wrappings with great curiosity, for Holmes did not normally give gifts. I opened the dark velvet jeweller's box and found inside a shiny new set of picklocks, a younger version of his own. ""Holmes, ever the romantic. Mrs. Hudson would be pleased.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I would have stolen it for you, had I known you were interested."" His voice was muffled by the door to the lumber room down the hallway, and I heard thumps and a crash."
SherlockHolmes,"“It has always seemed to me that so long as you produce your dramatic effect, accuracy of detail matters little. I have never striven for it and I have made some bad mistakes in consequence. What matter if I hold my readers?”"
SherlockHolmes,"“It's a very cheery thing to come into London by any of these lines which run high and allow you to look down upon the houses like this."""
SherlockHolmes,"“Man, or at least criminal man, has lost all enterprise and originality. As to my own little practice, it seems to be degenerating into an agency for recovering lost lead pencils and giving advice to young ladies from boarding-schools.”"
SherlockHolmes,“My book is extremely graphic. I make no apologies for it. But it is graphic only because I told the truth about what the Ripper did to his victims.”
SherlockHolmes,“My business is that of every other good citizen - to uphold the law.”
SherlockHolmes,“My horror at his crimes was lost in my admiration at his skill.”
SherlockHolmes,"“My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“My sympathies and my love went out to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave nature as had this one day of strange experiences. Yet there were two thoughts which sealed the words of affection upon my lips. She was weak and helpless, shaken in mind and nerve. It was to take her at a disadvantage to obtrude love upon her at such a time. Worst still, she was rich.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“No one except Sherlock Holmes thought he should be going anywhere, least of all his long-suffering doctor, but the game was afoot.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Oh how I've missed you, Holmes.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Only that I insist upon your dining with us. It will be ready in half an hour. I have oysters and a brace of grouse, with something a little choice in white wines. Watson, you have never yet recognized my merits as a housekeeper. ~ Sherlock Holmes”"
SherlockHolmes,“The more outré and grotesque an incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined.”
SherlockHolmes,"“To his eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the countryside, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year, Yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we passed, The rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of rotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for Nature to throw before the carriage of the returning heir of the Baskervilles.”"
SherlockHolmes,“When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock Holmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the fire.
SherlockHolmes,"“Y jamás se mostraba tan formidable como después de pasar días enteros en su sillón, sumido en sus improvisaciones y en sus libros antiguos.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“You have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.” My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them. I had already observed that he was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his art as any girl could be of her beauty.”"
SherlockHolmes,"""And if that fairy tale was to gradually lose its potency, well, such is life. What was not supposed to happen was her brutal honesty. The unspoken rule has always been that if a woman marries for money, she keeps that to herself and maintains an appearance of interest in her husband. Because that is what his money paid for. She is never supposed to not only confirm that she has never loved him but also denigrate him in the same breath for his said-to-be half-Jewish blood."""
SherlockHolmes,"""I didn't know Society ladies cared that those of Jewish roots should not be taunted for that fact,"" said Treadles."
SherlockHolmes,"""I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical man of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. I trust, sir, that I have not inadvertently--"""
SherlockHolmes,"""Indeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first?"" Asked Holmes, with some asperity."
SherlockHolmes,"""Just a little,"" said Holmes.”"
SherlockHolmes,"""Oh, cut out the hot air,"" interrupted Jinx rudely, ""and let's have the story.”"
SherlockHolmes,"""Then had you not better consult him?"""
SherlockHolmes,"""To the man of precised, scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon must always appeal strongly."""
SherlockHolmes,"""What? No, they didn't care about that. They cared that Lady Ingram didn't just tear the fairy tale in two but spat on it. They cared that this sent a shiver through all the men of Society. If a paragon such as Lord Ingram couldn't find a wife who genuinely loved him, what chance did the other gentlemen have?”"
SherlockHolmes,"""Why don't you tell me about myself, Mr. Holmes?”"
SherlockHolmes,"""You're not hurt, Watson? For God's sake say that you're not hurt!"""
SherlockHolmes,"“...Recognising, as I do, that you are the second highest expert in Europe--"""
SherlockHolmes,"“All his life, Sherlock Holmes had believed that when one had eliminated the impossible, whatever remained —however improbable— must be the truth. Now he understood that when the impossible was too intractable to be eliminated, one had to revise one's opinion of the limits of the possible.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Anna held up a small black-bound memorandum book. Cordelia hadn’t even seen her retrieve it. They strode out of the bedroom, Anna waving the book over her head in triumph. “This,” she announced, “will hold the answers to all our questions.”"
SherlockHolmes,“Are you in law enforcement?' he said.
SherlockHolmes,“Don’t we all!”
SherlockHolmes,"“Dr. Freud said he would like to see me again,” she said, finally."
SherlockHolmes,"“Hmm, let me see. Katherine, Alicia, Virginia—a very promising writer, you should look out for her work, James—Mariane, Virna, Eugenia—”"
SherlockHolmes,“I am inclined to think said I.
SherlockHolmes,“I believe that you are the devil himself!” he cried.
SherlockHolmes,"“I don’t mean that you’re emotionless, my dear. I just mean that your emotions are, themselves, efficient, rational. Please don’t misunderstand me—I admire you very much and I would like to be your friend. But you remind me of Sherlock more than anyone I’ve ever met.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I just bet he would!” Irene laughed. “He collects beetles of all sorts, and you resemble a gray beetle that seems ordinary, but shine a light on it and it begins to shimmer like an opal—blue and green, all cool colors for you, I think. You know, when all of you had just arrived here, I admired your self-control. Here you were in a strange country, determined to rescue a woman you didn’t know from a danger you didn’t understand, all because a friend had asked you to. You were tired from a long journey, yet there you were, coolly making plans. Then later I realized it wasn’t self-control at all—it’s simply the way you are, like Sherlock. He can’t help it either. When there’s a problem to be solved, he sits down and solves it: rationally, efficiently.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I know, my dear Watson, that you share my love of all that is bizarre and outside the conventions and humdrum routine of everyday life. You have shown your relish for it by the enthusiasm which has prompted you to chronicle, and, if you will excuse my saying so, somewhat to embellish so many of my own little adventures.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I looked at him anew, with an understanding I never had before and with awe for the magnitude of such a mind. In a flash I understood the cocaine, his moods, and his genius."" Remarkable Power of Stimulus, due out Nov. 2020.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I think that’s a compliment?” said Mary. “I mean, I find him dreadfully aggravating, sometimes. . . .”"
SherlockHolmes,"“I’d always hated those films—they’d portrayed Dr. Watson as a bumbling idiot, and Sherlock Holmes as an automaton.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“If my future were black, it was better surely to face it like a man than to attempt to brighten it by mere will-o’-the-wisps of the imagination.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“In nearly half a century of life together, two people build a vocabulary of glances and tones, permitting entire conversations that go unspoken.”"
SherlockHolmes,“Is it working?” said James.
SherlockHolmes,"“It is a pity he did not write in pencil. As you have no doubt frequently observed, the impression usually goes through -- a fact which has dissolved many a happy marriage.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Look here; I wasn't going to tell anybody about it, but I'll let you three in on it to make up for giving you such a scare. I got the idea from a book I found in the barn, ""The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes"". It's the best book I've come across in a long time, and you'll admit I know something about literature. I'll venture to say there isn't a pig in the country has a finer library or a wider knowledge of -"""
SherlockHolmes,“My mind rebels at stagnation”
SherlockHolmes,“Not my sister Eugenia?” Thomas nearly upended his cake.
SherlockHolmes,"“Of course not,” Anna declared. “It’s a memorandum book… about my conquests. That is an important but meaningful distinction.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Oh, probably not,” Anna said. “Laura, Lily… ah, Hypatia. Well, it was a brief encounter, and I suppose you might say she seduced me.…”"
SherlockHolmes,"“On glancing over my notes of the seventy odd cases in which I have during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock Holmes, I find many tragic, some comic, a large number merely strange, but none commonplace; for, working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“On Westminster Bridge, Arthur was struck by the brightness of the streetlamps running across like a formation of stars. They shone white against the black coats of the marching gentlefold and fuller than the moon against the fractal spires of Westminster. They were, Arthur quickly realized, the new electric lights, which the city government was installing, avenue by avenue, square by square, in place of the dirty gas lamps that had lit London's public spaces for a century. These new electric ones were brighter. They were cheaper. They required less maintenance. And they shone farther into the dime evening, exposing every crack in the pavement, every plump turtle sheel of stone underfoot. So long to the faint chiaroscuro of London, to the ladies and gentlemen in black-on-black relief. So long to the era of mist and carbonized Newcastle coal, to the stench of the Blackfriars foundry. Welcome to the cleasing glare of the twentieth century.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Over the green squares of the fields and the low curves of a wood there rose in the distance a grey, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged summit, dim and vague in the distance like some fantastic landscape in a dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his gaze fixed upon it, and I read upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and left their mark so deep.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Possibly,” said Anna, regarding the book. Cordelia couldn’t help but wonder: Was Ariadne’s name in there? Was she considered a conquest now, or something—someone—else?”"
SherlockHolmes,"“She used to say that. 'Boy, you got a hole in your life and you don't even see it.' Like it was my fault I couldn't figure out something they'd hidden from me. He tossed the doll into the crate, then reached down to flip through the Dickens novel, as if looking for a bookmark left behind; Some of the loose pages spilled out.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“So you might describe me,” said Holmes cheerfully. “My companion is also a dangerous ruffian. And together we are going through your house.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“Sou um leitor ávido, com uma memória extraordinária para coisas sem importância”.”"
SherlockHolmes,“Sterndale sprang to his feet.
SherlockHolmes,"“Tell me about yourself, Miss Russell."""
SherlockHolmes,“The Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands but those of the highly educated.”
SherlockHolmes,"“There are very few heiresses among the women jockeying for eligible gentlemen on the marriage mart. And the cost of failure is high: lifelong dependence on disappointed parents and indifferent brothers, perhaps even the necessity of becoming a lady's companion or, worse, a governess. No one would have thought any less of Lady Ingram for marrying the richest man she could find, certainly not when he happened to be both striking in appearance and sterling of character. Her success was a fairy tale, something to aspire to."
SherlockHolmes,"“This is less the intricate weavings of an arachnid, Mr. Holmes, as a ball of wool after a kitten has finished with it,"" said Lestrade, with some asperity.”"
SherlockHolmes,“To begin at the beginning.”
SherlockHolmes,"“Well, and there is the end of our little drama,"" I remarked, after we had sat some time smoking in silence. ""I fear that it may be the last investigation in which I shall have the chance of studying your methods. Miss Morstan has done me the honour to accept me as a husband in prospective."""
SherlockHolmes,"“Well, that hardly seems fair,” said James. “Like someone solving a case before Sherlock Holmes. If I were you I would feel challenged, as if to a duel.”"
SherlockHolmes,“Where is your warrant?”
SherlockHolmes,"“Why, you’re a common burglar.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“You British have built an empire on empiricism. You pay lip service to religion and the mysteries of the divine, but it is cold, hard fact that you really worship. You look upward with your telescopes and downward with your microscopes, and there, in space and water drops, the stars and bacteria, do you find God.”"
SherlockHolmes,"“You see, but you do not observe”"
SherlockHolmes,A complete puzzler. I couldn't make anything out of it. Bernie laughed and gave me a quick scratch between the ears. 'Which makes me Dr. Watson.”
