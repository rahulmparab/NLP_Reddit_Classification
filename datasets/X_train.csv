"My Thoughts on A Scandal in Bohemia Though we often think of Sherlock Holmes as a character of short stories, it wasn‚Äôt until his third outing that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle moved into the medium. The author would write a further 55 stories alongside 4 novels ‚Äì beginning with *A Study in Scarlet* and *The Sign of Four*.

Other than the masterful *The Hound of the Baskervilles*, I have always preferred Holmes in shorter fiction. I find that reading through a single mystery before sleep is the perfect way to wrap a day ‚Äì allowing the setup, deductions and resolution to clear my mind of the day.

It‚Äôs no surprise to me that in these odd times we live in, with the shops opening for the first time in three months today, vital anti-racism protests ongoing while racists are seemingly flushed from the gutter onto the streets of our cities, I have retreated into these stories again. They have given me comfort for two decades ‚Äì allowing me to believe that right and wrong can be separated by good people, that right will win out and that intelligence can be directed to the most virtuous causes.  

It‚Äôs interesting then, that *A Scandal in Bohemia* fails in reassuring any of these concerns in the reader. The client, a European royal, has an indiscretion to cover up, Holmes does not succeed in his mission and the greater intelligence prevails in escaping with the evidence.

In the story, Holmes is tasked with recovering an embarrassing photograph of a Bohemian King who‚Äôs set to marry but is being blackmailed by his former lover Irene Adler. The detective must locate the evidence and secure it in just a few days or the marriage will end before it begins.

Conan Doyle doesn‚Äôt get the credit he deserves for the bold choices he makes, as most praise rightly falls on his iconic characters of Holmes, Watson, Lestrade, Moriarty and the perfectly rendered London they populate. Yet here, just like in *The Hound of the Baskervilles* where Watson takes centre stage, he does the unexpected.  In Holmes‚Äô return to the page and debut short story, he fails.

He‚Äôs defeated ‚Äì and only by a few hours, I must add ‚Äì by Irene Adler. In later adaptions, Adler and Holmes are often pitched as would-be lovers but there‚Äôs not a hint of that here. His admiration for her is down to her cunning and wit, perhaps too her acceptance that while she bested Holmes for a moment, all she could do to escape him for good was leave the country. In keeping her photograph as payment, the great detective earns a reminder that he is not perfect and that there are parts of the human experience that he may never know.

Present for the first time in *A Scandal in Bohemia* is the artwork of Sidney Paget, whose depictions of Holmes in *The Strand* magazine are as influential as Conan Doyle‚Äôs writing. It‚Äôs from Paget‚Äôs hand that we get the iconic silhouette of Holmes, the devious face of Moriarty and their famous grapple above the Reichenbach Falls.

It‚Äôs a wonderful introduction to the type of Holmes story that made him the enduring character he became. Thanks to Conan Doyle‚Äôs brave choices and a story that raises the great detective‚Äôs profile as it pulls him down to Earth, *A Scandal in Bohemia* was the beginning of a magnificent literary legacy."

Even in the following novel, A Sign of Four, Sherlock mentions that he read the book which can't have an all-knowing being write a story that Sherlock read in a world where such things don't exist. I'm aware the stories probably aren't supposed to be looked at like this, but it's fun so, what do you guys think the in-canon solution is?"

"Help Me Remember This Specific Sherlock Publication/Anthology So details are a bit fuzzy on this, so please bear with me.

Around fifteen or so years ago, my brother's high school English teach lent him some kind of... file folder/publication of ""handwritten"" letters and typewritten notes authored in the perspective of Watson as ""supplemental material on Sherlock Holmes."" Kind of like an extension of the actual stories themselves. I was fairly young at the time, so don't remember reading *too* much as I wasn't the Holmes fan I am now, but my brother recalls it was some sort of anthology that ended with ""The Final Problem."" 

The cover was literally just a manila folder with the title typed in on a typewriter.

So now I'm trying to root around and find out exactly what middle-school age me was exactly looking at. Does anyone have *any* remote idea of what this publication might be?"

"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 13 I had been out in the British hinterlands, something I find disagreeable at the best of times. I do not care for things to be out of place, particularly me. So, to say I was disconcerted as the colony came into view would be understatement. I was forced to hesitate and consider that some delayed hallucination might be affecting my brain. The cause, though, was immediately apparent - and founded in fact. There were now two cottages. The second being a mirror of, but at right angles to, the original. It was, of course, at the beginnings of construction and not yet habitable. But I had not been forewarned. I was not prepared.

Sherlock was seated at an outside table looking very comfortable with a closed book in his lap, not asleep but in reverie.

""Sherlock, I don't believe I've seen you so content in quite some time.""

""Good afternoon, Mycroft.

""A partial reason I am pleased is that the carpenters have taken their lunch and, at least for the moment, ceased their infernal racket.

""I apologize for not consulting you, but the plan Miss Adler put forth for expanding her quarters would have more than doubled its size. I decided the prudent remedy was to start from scratch. More convenient for her but, as it transpires, less so for me.

""Fortunately though, that irritation is being mitigated by a feeling of personal triumph. I am basking in the resolve of a most difficult, intriguing and long enduring dilemma. It may take some time for substantiation, but I'm as confident today as can be.

""We have touched on the matter before... I have been conducting a self interrogation, an introspection, if you will. I've strenuously pulled at the threads of Miss Adler's 'rational sentiment' garment and found it sturdy and, just perhaps, suitable to wear. I am come to conclude that contentment is when a man's logic and his emotions coincide. And it is fair to pronounce that melding... reasonable.""

""As you say, Sherlock, that is indeed more than reasonable. Have you discussed this with the lady?"", I inquired.

""What a preposterous thought, Mycroft. Why ever should I do such a thing? What's it got to do with her?""

.

""I was at Sherlock's cottage when the telephone rang through with my three-short code. It was Mrs. Hudson and I therefore knew it was important.""

""Mr. Holmes"", she breathlessly began, ""I apologize for bothering you, but I have a concern which only you can address.

""Early this morning a military gentleman arrived at the house. He produced a letter of authorization which he purported to be from your office. He claimed he was in the city for a meeting with you and requested a place to await your return.

""It took me a few moments to realize his attire looked 'off'. He wore the uniform of the 2nd Battalion, York and Lancaster Regiment, but the badging was wrong. I only know this because my nephew belongs to that regiment and has bored me to tears with it's history. He's a sweet fellow but his conversation is that of a nephew who can think of nothing else to discuss with an aunt he rarely sees.

""The gentleman at the door acted as though he believed this to be your home. I thought it odd, but I am used to odd.

""I told him you might be quite late getting back and I showed him to a room and went for fresh linens. When I returned he was freshening up in the bath. I knocked and told him I was leaving towels at the door and changing the bed should he wish to use it. As I did so I looked around to see if everything was in order. The room was fine, but several of the gentleman's belongings also seemed not quite right. That prompted me to look into his valise. At the bottom was a Luger pistol. 

""This could all have an innocent explanation, although do I know your people are sticklers for detail and do not make trivial mistakes. But perhaps it is my unforgivable sin questioning your associates.""

""Mrs. Hudson, you are perfectly correct to suspect this person. I am now worried about your safety. I can send officers to apprehend him, but if he is armed you may be in great danger.""

""No, no, Mr. Holmes, please do not distress yourself. I might not have admitted it if my judgement was wrong, but the gentleman will be no threat for most of the day. I offered him soup for lunch which he accepted and consumed with gusto. The soup contained a large dose of castor oil. I promise he will be agitated but of no threat when your officers arrive.""

"Best 'present day' Sherlock Holmes stories over the decades? I'm talking about contemporary versions of Sherlock Holmes, set in whatever was then the 'present day'. 

In the 21st century we have a lot of great examples with Sherlock, Elementary and more recently, Miss Sherlock.

The WW2 era gave us the Basil Rathbone films of course.

But I'm interested in other contemporary post-Victorian takes on Sherlock Holmes over the decades. For instance, is there a 70's Sherlock? Or a Rolling Twenties Sherlock?

Or, for the most part, have there only ever been adaptations set in the original Victorian era, barring the Rathbone films and more recent efforts?

I'm talking books, movies, TV, anything."

"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 11 Our new scouts were an eclectic trio. Aside from a heightened ability to observe and retain, we didn't wish to limit what might be presented to us. We went about hunting for a financial sleuth in the same manner, but the ultimate answer fell into our lap by total chance.

Finding competent actuaries, analysts, and auditors was not difficult. That, however, was not exactly what we needed. The very best we interviewed were honest men and, to the contrary, we required someone at least as knowledgeable about the dishonest side of things.

Sherlock, Miss Adler, and I were discussing that dilemma in the mess one afternoon. Hauser was bustling about in preparation for the evening meal. We thought nothing of his overhearing our conversation until he gave us one of those I-hate-to-interrupt throat clearings.

""I hope you won't find this suggestion presumptuous."" he said. ""When I was a guest of the Pentonville Prison, there was another inmate by the name of Ignatius Boggs. I became acquainted with him because he worked in the garden. He was a legend among the other prisoners. It was claimed he could make a ledger sing like a operatic score. If my memory serves correctly he still has many years on his term, but would you really need your man to 'live in'?

I arranged for an officious official to speak with the prison warden. Said conversation elicited that Boggs, having been sentenced on multiple charges, would indeed be confined for quite some time. The warden did allow, however, that Boggs, other than his propensity for taking a shilling from your column and shifting it onto his own, was a model prisoner and a very likeable fellow.

The officious official spoke directly to Boggs and explained that His Majesty's government would be appreciative - in the form of continuing aids to Mr. Boggs comfort - for his occasional skills in analyzing financial dealings to discover what was really at the heart. Boggs was assured that the object of these inquiries would be foreigners lest honor among his thieving cohorts be a concern. 

Boggs responded that he would be pleased to be of service. 

.

Our friend Boggs immediately proved to be an invaluable asset. Not only could he track the path of any group investments, he could usually identify the individuals it comprised. Provided with a biography of the participants, he would give us reasons, other than the expected profit motive, why and how those individuals were included. In other words, who had access to privileged information and to whom he passed it along.

There did, however, occur a glitch in this arrangement.

Boggs had expressed a desire to continue his outdoor duties and requested from the warden, as part of his raised status, improved and additional gardening implements. These included, but were not restricted to, bamboo canes and jute cord to support his British runner beans.

A month from becoming our expert on financial matters, Ignatius Boggs fashioned a series of ladders and did a bunk from Pentonville Prison. His escape was more contrived than that, but the result would not change by going into more detail. In the investment investigation arena, the colony was back to square one.

Two weeks passed and we were still laboring to fill a gap we didn't know existed two months earlier. As it happened, though, a letter addressed to my officious official was forwarded to me. It read...

&gt; Please excuse my opportunistic leave of absence. I hold no grudges if you don't. In fact, I am open to resuming my activities if you'd care. From the glimpses I've seen so far, I believe doing so would be for the good of my country which I do dearly love - despite it's not loving me sometimes - for understandable reasons. In addition, being at liberty outside of the UK I may even be able to offer better service with greater access to more external instruction.

&gt; If you are amenable please advise in care of the address below.

&gt; Sincerely,

&gt;  Ignatius Boggs
    
The address was a Swiss postal box.

Everyone was receptive but the warden. His opinion was presumed, of course, since he was not informed of our reconstructed association.

Henry Cavill on playing a Sherlock with emotions
"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 7 Wallace is the colony's procurement officer as well being in charge of large and small construction. He also possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of engineering. Above all, he is imaginative.

Sherlock, Adler, and I gave him a list of what we thought might be needed and an encapsulated version of what we hoped to accomplish. He made a few additions, which Holmes seemed to understand, and subtractions, items which we could purchase along the way. Most of our requirements would be of German manufacture in case of discovery.

.

Sherlock relates the venture...

It was decided that everything but our persons would be crated at another location and taken across the Strait in a normal manner. On the first moonless night we would take Miss Adler's since-repaired row boat back across to the French coast. The following day we would purchase a cart to pick up the delivery and travel far enough inland where we could exchange it for a conveyance more suitable for speed and distance.

We made good time on the first day, reaching Ghent where we found comfortable and much appreciated lodgings. It was another two days before we reached Essen, our destination. The coach and team was left at a stable for boarding. A humble cart and horse was rented from another. At a third I purchased a horse and saddle. Miss Adler and Blocke took the cart and went in search of accommodations for a couple come to find employment at the Krupp works. After a short time I booked in at the same hotel as a businessman with appointments at the works. We planned to meet again for dinner to share notes.

Assuming the trappings of a land surveyor I rode off to Bredeney, home to the Villa H√ºgel and the Krupp family, built by Alfred Krupp in 1873 as a residence. It fit the owner of a company which had a near monopoly in heavy arms manufacture in Germany.

.

Gustav Krupp was born Gustav von Bohlen und Halbach in The Hague. He was a grandson of an American Civil War General Henry Bohlen. Through the encouragement of Emperor Kaiser William II he married Bertha Krupp in 1906. Bertha had inherited her family's company when her father committed suicide, but it was considered unthinkable for the Krupp empire to be headed by a woman. The Kaiser decreed that Gustav would be allowed to add the Krupp name to his own. Gustav became the company's chairman in 1909.

Miss Adler and Blocke went separate ways. Blocke recounted later that the Krupp company was a member and major funder of the Pan-German League which was mobilizing popular support in favor of raising Germany's standing army to 738,000 men. Miss Adler found a resurgence of nationalist sentiment wherever she went. Separately we visited taverns and meeting halls well into the night listening to gossip and directing the conversation when we might.

The following day our plan was much the same except my target was the factory. It was immense. The fumes belching from the chimney stacks formed a miasma covering the city and for miles around. Standing motionless one became filthy. A film of grit covered every surface. Breathing was an irritation.

I made drawings of the complex buildings and their functions, taking discrete photographs when I could. Toward nightfall I rode around the periphery noting the new excavations and guessed at their possible purpose from the adjacent structures. That evening was a repeat of the night before, going anywhere where people might congregate after a hard day's labor.

The morning of our third day we met to compare our findings. The general distillation from the gathered chatter was that the leaders were gearing up for something, but (1) those running the country knew what they were about and, anyway, it was most likely chest beating, beside, those fill-in-the-blank poltroons deserved what they'd get, (2) the prospect of conflict wouldn't affect them adversely because they had critical jobs.

Agricultural workers, coming to town to sell their produce or make purchases, felt the same way - someone else would do any fighting. The bosses and managers sang from the same hymnal and quoted from a plethora of newly installed motivational posters (propaganda).
As much effort as we had put in, it only reinforced what we already knew back at the colony four days ago.

""We're in the wrong place. Tomorrow we must move to Bredeney. You two take the cart. You will be hoping for jobs at the Villa and wish to learn if any openings are available and how the staff is treated. I'll arrive on horseback as an avid fisherman aching to try my luck at the nearby Baldeneysee reservoir and the Ruhr river. I'll want recommendations of the best spots, with a pint or two at the local ale house as reward.""

The results from those activities proved productive. ""The Krupps, separately and together, entertain and are entertained a good deal. Gustav goes to the plant everyday like clockwork at 10am. He meets with male colleagues for cards twice a month. By the best of fortune tomorrow night is one of those occasions. I have a plan.""

Before dawn the next morning the three of us were found uprooting a small tree along the route Krupp would take. We'd retrieved the carriage and Blocke was kitted out in the finest livery. Miss Adler walked up the road to a point where she could see us but not be seen from the opposite direction. At her signal we toppled the tree, Blocke made as though he was pulling it from the way of our carriage as I looked on with an aggrieved expression of irritation. Krupp's carriage pulled up and his driver, after conferring with his master, proceeded to help. Krupp exited and we acknowledged each other. ""Herr Krupp?"", I volunteered across the barrier, ""Allow me to introduce myself, I am Baron Fran√ßois Empain, brother to √âdouard Empain of Belgium, you may be familiar with our family.""

""Most pleased to meet you, Baron. I regret I am in a hurry. I hope you enjoy our region."" With that he reentered his carriage and after a few moments a path was clear and he was carried away.

""Blighter!""

We delayed a while so not to reencounter Krupp as we returned to Essen and our rooms. 

.

After a long period of silence Miss Adler spoke up, ""Do either of you think we could learn anything if we put Herr Krupp under duress?"" Blocke and I cautiously agreed that was possible.

""Then let us kidnap the pompous ass. I don't see we have much to loose.""

.

It was agreed Blocke would conduct the interview in the jargon of an aristocrat. We would use the Adler technique of alluding to knowledge we did not possess and see where that led.

The scheme was to intercept the man as he left to join his friends for cards. That evening we stood in the middle of the lengthy drive which joined the villa to the public road. We had our faces masked but wore the attire of gentlemen. Miss Adler and I, flanking Blocke in the center, held lanterns to counter the appearance of threat.

Krupp's coach approached, slowed, and then stopped. Blocke spoke in an authoritative but not loud voice which somehow conveyed benevolent superiority. ""Herr Krupp, I wish private words with you concerning matters of importance.""

After assuring him, should the occasion arise, the German government would guarantee indemnity for his company should his exports to certain other countries be curtailed, he became a veritable font.

.

The cart had been returned. The horse resold. The loaded carriage was a short half-mile away. We attained it in ten minutes and headed west to trace our prior itinerary in reverse.

"The original novels, the complete canon audiobook set, OTR radio broadcasts, BBC radio series, 2009 film, or the new Sherlock BBC series - where to begin? I was recently bitten by the detective bug so I purchased the first single-volume edition of the Annotated Sherlock Holmes (a 10 pound mammoth beast of a book!), and secured a handsome mahogany bookcase to protect it from shelf-wear.  
  
In the days that followed I picked up the complete canon audiobook collection, unabridged, read by John Telfer.
  
Always the completist, I also sprang for the Old Time Radio New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes with Basil Rathbone which were broadcast between 1938-1964.  220 shows have survived, and 53 are currently known to be in circulation.
  
Next I snatched up the 64 CD 48 hr box set of the BBC dramatizations of all 56 of the Sherlock Holmes stories.
  
I'm not big on cinema so I have yet to see the 2009 film or the BBC television series (though I hear it's wonderful stuff and Moffat hasn't failed me yet.)
  
Thus far I've listened to 6 of the audiobook stories and enjoyed them very much.  Telfer does an excellent job voicing each of the characters.
  
My question to r/sherlockholmes is this:  
  
Are there particular stories/episodes from the series and books above which you recommend as essential reading/listening?  I've read that the earlier Rathbone broadcasts are better than the shows that came later.  
  
I'm sitting on 140 hours of audio material and over 1500 pages of annotated tales... where do I begin?  And is there anything important that I am missing?
  
THANK you for any/all recommendations!"

Has anyone read the Stephen king short story about Sherlock Holmes?
"My ""Jim Moriarty is alive"" Theory There's something that I cannot stop thinking about... So Moriarty worked with Eurus right? and he recorded the ""did you miss me?"" video... does that mean he anticipated his own death? when he shot himself on the roof? because why else would he record these videos if he didn't know he was going to die? 


Now listen I'll elaborate. In the fall episode, Jim's plan was to make Sherlock fall off the roof and basically die.. or thats what we're supposed to think. Because why would he record a video for Sherlock when Sherlock is supposed to be dead? unless it wasn't really what he wanted. He knew he was going to ""kill himself"".. but if thats true then what was his plan? 


Maybe Moriarty was planning for something bigger and needed to convince Sherlock that he's dead. Now he could've done it in a less dramatic way but maybe he thought that Sherlock wouldn't really believe that a mastermind with many guards and snipers walking around him would be easily killed, so he had to ""kill himself"" in front of Sherlock to make him believe so.


What happened to Jim's body? who retrieved it? we saw nothing about that. What happened to the snipers? 


1. maybe they took him home and he started hiding, just like Sherlock did after the fall. 


2. maybe he had some sort of deal with Mycroft and it wouldn't be the first time we see Mycroft needing Jim or making a deal with him. 


3. What if Mycroft put Jim in Sherrinford that maximum security prision island? the same way he convinced his parentes that Eurus was dead and put her in Sherrinford."

15 best adaptations of Sherlock Holmes - I ALMOST agree with the list
"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 6 Two months passed before I returned again to the colony. I arrived late and retired early. Sherlock was breakfasting alone in the cottage when I joined him the next morning.

""You look absorbed, Sherlock.""

""For a while I have been gnawing on a very large bone... to be more accurate, since Miss Adler has proved herself so valuable to our efforts.

""We both agree she has a first rate mind, analytic and observant. She can be quick or deliberate depending on the demands. She is unquenchably curious. In addition, it pains me to admit, she many times sees dimensional aspects of a question you and I might miss. She is better at predicting what we might consider irrationality than we are. What I am being forced to accept is that she effectively integrates rational sentiment into her dissection of complex situations. I'm not comfortable with that concept, but she can justify her conclusions most logically.

""For decades I have spent much of my energies searching for facts, believing the path to correct interpretation was gained by separating and eliminating emotion from reason. Wishing for an investigation to go a certain way or in favor of certain people, those are impediments. Emotion is the mold on the bread, the bruise on the pear, the curdle in the milk.

""I know I am correct that emotion ofttimes corrupts rational thinking, but what if I've been wrong believing eradication is the correct nostrum. I often rely on intuition - I trust that inner influence to be pure, based upon a lifetime of unsullied deduction. What if that impulse is actually an unconscious amalgam? Would it not be ironic if the emotion of pride is blocking my bit of self interrogation? No, I'm not comfortable with this line of introspection.

""Do you know, Mycroft, Gill later informed me it took him three trips to fetch the boxes she brought back from London? He could not imagine how she got them all onto the poor horse. He suspects a stint as a balancing act circus performer in a prior life.

""The woman wants her cabin enlarged.""

.

I may have left the reader with an untrue impression that Sherlock was in permanent residence at the colony. In fact he maintained other abodes and identities and traveled a good deal. So it occurred that Sherlock was scheduled to leave the colony before my business was complete. That presented no problem because it was Blocke with whom I still needed to speak.

I found him in deep conversation with Miss Adler. They abruptly became silent at my approach. Being of a suspicious nature I asked what they were hatching. After a few awkward moments of hesitation the lady admitted they were probing the feasibility of a plan.

""We have become convinced there is one way to discover what lies behind the activities of the arms merchants and the financiers - go to them, specifically Gustav Krupp. How best to do that is what we've been working on.

""I'm not suggesting we knock on the Krupp door at Villa H√ºgel in Essen. We can, however, get a good sense of the man from where he lives and the attitudes of his workers toward him. Granted, we have had our reports, but they come from amateurs. Conversely, you must admit there are a scant few as adept at seeing beneath the surface than the two of us. Traveling as an itinerant couple we would draw no attention. There are no more invisible people than the working class.""

That gave me pause. I had to appreciate the merits of their proposal, but the perils were monumental. Not only would there be danger to themselves but to the work in the colony should they be detained - or worse. Their contributions here were critical. The biggest hurdle, though, would be Sherlock.

I asked sufficient questions to assure myself they had been thorough in their deliberations. I promised the couple I would broach the idea to Sherlock when next I saw him. That would be in London in two days time.

.

We lunched at a discrete restaurant near the Inner Temple and afterward walked along the Victoria Embankment. Trusting my brother to be at his most receptive I presented the Adler-Blocke proposition. He was quiet for such a time that I had to prompt him for a response.

He surprised me greatly. ""It has merit"", he said. ""What could be more nondescript than a husband, wife and, perhaps, his aged mother? That would justify a small wagon, empty of goods, but with space to hide sundry items which might prove helpful. It will require significant preparation, but its boldness appeals to me.""

"MR. HOLMES (review), a masterful portrait that fans &amp; non fans alike can appreciate."
"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 15 Mr. Wallace rightly insists I include the evolution of Mr. Rice's domain in any recital of the colony. Mr. Rice is equally firm on the subject. The reader should understand, though, each is in awe of the other‚Äôs accomplishments and wishes them recognized.

.

Mr. Rice is tasked with distilling and cataloguing the disparate bits of information which come in from Sherlock's informal sources and from our colony-trained scouts and their sources. Everything is archived and cross referenced. Rice has also become the facility's librarian.

Most of Sherlock's own collection now falls under Rice's care. Miss Adler and all of the permanent residents have contributed not insignificant numbers relating to their own fields of interest. The colony library is equal in size to that of a modest university. The ever-increasing volume of material is indexed by a decimal classification system. Every book, newspaper, text, or report is assigned a number which exactly locates a position relative to other material in the library on the basis of its subject. The number makes it simple to find any reference and to return it to its proper place on the library shelves.

In conjunction, engineer Wallace's efforts on behalf of Rice‚Äôs work have been nothing short of Herculean. The physical space Rice currently oversees is three times what he formerly owned. How that end was gained follows‚Ä¶

Wallace was presented with a three prong challenge - provide Rice with additional archival space, keep the facility unobtrusive, disrupt Rice as little as possible. Wallace spent several days examining the integrity of the existing building. Pronouncing it sound he turned his attentions to adjacent excavation for an ‚Äòaddition‚Äô. A large pit was dug to exact specifications and location. Into it concrete foundation walls and a floor were poured. A grid of metal rods was joined to reinforce a concrete ceiling which allowed for a center stairwell.

A dozen navvies from the Shorncliffe Military Camp had been employed up to that stage. On the final and critical day the number was tripled. A man was stationed every three feet around the perimeter of the original building, each was equipped with a five foot steel levering bar. The plan was to raise the structure one quarter of an inch at each command of ‚Äúup‚Äù. Runners with shimming blocks would insure each raise, at each man. At a ‚Äúdown‚Äù command the lever fulcrums would be repositioned for the next raise. Wallace kept circling the project to make certain all was safe and true. In short order a chant developed... ‚Äúup‚Äù,  ‚Äúgrunt‚Äù,  ‚Äúdown‚Äù,  ‚Äúsigh‚Äù. And so it progressed.

When the desired height was attained dozens of four inch diameter poles were passed through the gap to allow the structure to be ‚Äòrolled‚Äô into its new position. Wallace was a dervish. As each pole became exposed at the rear it was brought to the fore. Finally, at its intended destination, the raising/lowering procedure resumed in reverse.

None of the building‚Äôs contents or furnishings had been removed, and all survived in tact. 

Not a book had dropped from a shelf. Not a map had fallen from a wall. The navvies insisted paper must have the same weight equivalent of granite.

Rice, who had been nervously watching for the entire time, claimed he was in need of a whiskey and a nap. Before he made his escape, however, he insisted on christening the new space with its first new volume. He produced a small blue book. On the cover was printed in golden letters, Practical Handbook of Bee Culture, with Some Observations upon the Segregation of the Queen, author, Sherlock Holmes.

Wallace and the workers repaired to the mess for a well deserved meal and a bit of self-congratulatory celebration warning that the colony‚Äôs meade stores might need replenishing before they were done.

.

A recent example of Mr. Rice's amazing facility for drawing lines from fragmentary dots is highlighted in the tragic tale of Alvar Hahn. The completed picture was supplied by our Berlin trio of Habib, Cottle, and Gill. The reader should appreciate the trail of crumbs Rice followed to bring the matter to the colony's attention were only determined to be of importance after the fact.

The first bit of puzzle was a newspaper report of a naval weapon‚Äôs advance being pursued by the Krupp ship works in Hamburg. A second, from Boggs our financial virtuoso, was of a consortium formed to finance a mechanism to improve the accuracy of naval gunnery. Boggs supplied a list of investors. Rice prompted our agent, Habib, to determine if any of the four principals were clients of Mr. Kappel at the Berenberg Bank. A Mr. Alvar Hahn was, and had a very sizeable overdue loan. Boggs came back to report that pressure was being applied to the original investors to increase their commitment and were being offered implausible returns to do so.

It was pieced together, again with suggestions from Rice, that the mechanism was indeed a valid undertaking. It was a gyro mounting for a large caliber ship's gun which would compensate for the rise and fall of a vessel when aiming in rough waters. The syndicate behind the investment, however, was straw. There was no path any profit could be realized in the short period promised.

With the hope of uncovering more details of the project, Habib, Cottle, and Gill reestablished temporary residence in Hamburg and, in turns, took to watching Hahn. They even discovered, with a little agility, they could see into his exclusive apartment by way of a skylight accessible from an adjoining building. And so it happened that Gill was witness from above when, only two nights after scrutiny of Hahn began, three men arrived at the man‚Äôs door.

Gill could not distinguish all of the preliminary conversation but, as it proceeded, voices were raised. The gist was that Hahn was in desperate need of a payment from his partners immediately or he would be ruined. In blunt terms he was told he was not the player he imagined himself to be and further, if he could not increase his stake in the scheme, he was out.

Hahn alternately threatened and pleaded with the men. They, in turn, scornfully pointed out, had he fully read their agreement, he would realize he was vulnerable and they were not. Hahn had been blinded by greed. He owed more than he was worth. He would be totally disgraced and sent to prison. The man was reduced to sobs.

With cold detachment his former 'partners' suggested Mr. Hahn was left with a single recourse. As the vile trinity made to leave, the last turned and placed a revolver on a table next to the door.

Hahn read the implied message and colapsed further into his seat and into abject dispair.

The voyeur, Gill, was as paralyzed by the preceding as was Hahn.

The pitiable creature sat for several minutes staring at the carpet between his feet, perhaps in hope there might be an answer woven into its pattern. At length he arose, went to a drinks cabinet, poured a large measure of liquor into a crystal glass, went to the door,  retrieved the revolver, and returned to his chair. There he sat, staring at his drink just as he had the carpet. 

After some time Hahn seemed to regain himself. He sipped at his drink. And when it was finished he picked up the gun, put it to his head and fired the weapon.

Gill could not believe what had just transpired. Much against his will he kept returning his gaze to the scene below to confirm that which his brain refused to fathom. At length he made his way off the roof and back to the company of Cottle and Habib.

Half an hour later the three were discussing the matter over their own drinks. Habib had several questions and seemed most able to disassociate his thinking from the horror. ""Could you see the gun after Hahn shot himself?"" Gill replied he could. ""Are you certain it was a revolver and not a pistol?"" He was. ""Might we reasonably condemn the three men as Hahn's ultimate murderers?"" Gill and Cottle agreed.

Habib outlined a plan. It would not require the three of them, but each wanted to take part. Cottle fetched a cylindrical canvas bag from their stock of identity disguising gear suggested by Sherlock, and they set off for Hahn's building.

After they attained the roof, Cottle extracted from the bag a three-part fishing rod. From the vantage of the open skylight he managed, within a few attempts, to snag the finger guard of the revolver. He then slowly reeled in the gun to their waiting hands.

Back again at their own accommodations they celebrated 'the perfect crime'. Hahn's tormentors would prove to be his last visitors. They would be identified by the building's concierge, and probably by others. They would be charged with his death. And they would, most reasonably, be convicted.

"Elements that you expect in Sherlock Holmes adaptations Please correct me if I'm wrong as I haven't watch/read a lot of adaptation of Sherlock, but I figure this might be an interesting topic.

There are a lot of adaptations out there and each of them are trying to take the original spirit of Sherlock Holmes and put a new spin to it, such as they're taking Sherlock drug 'addiction' as one of his conflict in ""Elementary"" or making all of them female like Japanese's version ""Miss Sherlock"". But as far as I watch/read, most of them kept the Sherlock and Watson's original occupation and dynamic intact, even in modern setting.

This has me wondering, what elements do you expect to find in a Sherlock-themed adaptation? What are things that you wish Sherlock authors/creators' keep from the original Sherlock, because if it's changed, it would just ruin 'Sherlock'?

Oh, and if you guys have a recommendation of Sherlock adaptations that differs quite a lot from the original (i.e. Sherlock or Watson has different job or different personality), do comment below, I'm really interested to read/watch them all! Except for the Will Ferell movie because I have watched it and I think we all can agree it is one of the worst adaptation of Holmes.

Thank you in advance!"
Who's the REAL Sherlock Holmes? Introduction
"How many books? I was looking into buying the book set for Sherlock Holmes on Amazon but I don't know how many books there are. From what I read there are 4 novels but on amazon, there are sets with 4, 6, and 8 books can someone please clear that up. Also, can you check the linked page to tell me if those are the real books?"
"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 12 The most enigmatic of our new members is Habib. When his selection was being reviewed, Sherlock and I were noncommittal. Miss Adler was a strong proponent. We agreed if she felt so strongly he was worth a trial.

His physical attributes are so nondescript as to render him almost memorable for his unremarkability. He is of somewhat darker skin and could have originated from almost anywhere. He was, in fact, born at St Giles Hospital in the heart of London to Maltese parents who had emigrated from the protectorate two years before his birth. His father worked for the Anglo-Egyptian Bank.

Habib does have one unique feature. His eyes seem to focus on everything within their range but the oddity is that he can shut down that facility instantly. He may go from heightened concentration, lending the impression of singular intelligence, to vacuity, making one wonder if he is simple-minded. Witnessing the transformation can be very disconcerting.

Whether there is a connection or not, Mr. Habib has informed us he is color blind. Sherlock was aware of this phenomenon. It is the inability or decreased ability to see color, or perceive color differences, under normal lighting conditions. There is no actual blindness, but there is a deficiency of color vision.

Some color blind people are better at penetrating certain color camouflages. There is also a belief that people with some types of color blindness can distinguish colors that people with normal vision are not able to see.

The former has borne out with Habib. All of the colony buildings which might appear discordant from a distance are painted in a manner to disguise their use or even existence. He has made valuable suggestions for improvement. He spotted our radio towers immediately.

.

Our third candidate, Hensen, I am displeased to report, did not pan out. A week into his training he attempted to enter Miss Adler's cottage in the middle of the night. The lady is a light sleeper. She broke his nose. He was spirited from the colony before his head could clear. His first and only instructor, Blocke, made assurances to us that Hensen had gained nothing which might compromise our purpose or location. We do, however, hope he learned a lesson.

.

The original idea behind our continental infiltrators was to dispatch them idividually to various regions as needs arose. What we were coming to respect was the more we learned, the more we needed to learn. There was a need to broaden Sherlock's original web of amateur irregulars. There was a need to have knowledgeable agents in place before their services might be called upon. And, finally, there was a need for those local agents to be steeped in the cultural fabric.

.

Cottle and Habib were nearing the end of their training and, more important, gaining a sense of what they were being trained for. The pair approached Miss Adler to ask if it were possible they might take on their assignments as a team. The duo had become chums. Their aptitudes did not coincide but Miss Adler determined their proficiencies did compliment each other. Cottle was more gregarious, more physical, more 'one of the lads'. Habib was quicker of mind, could almost vanish in a crowd, and was hyper sensitive to nuance.
We decided this was not merely acceptable but desirable. And we had just the place to send them. All strands of a cause-and-effect web were leading to Berlin.

We gave Pencer a week to devise a secure communication plan and Rice the same to devise a code if one were required. The mail could only be depended upon so far. It was determined Gill would sail with Cottle and Habib to Hamburg. He would judge if that city were suitable for our revised stratagem. Before departing, the three would undergo intense immersion in the German language under Blocke.

.

The following is a pieced-together log of their first months.

Both Hamburg and Berlin were meccas for travelers, businessmen, and wielders of power. While Gill settled himself in Hamburg, Cottle and Habib did the same in Berlin. The latter pair framed a scheme casting Cottle as a card sharp looking to 'pluck some pigeons'. He went about dressed with a bit of flash drafting street urchins to keep him apprised of who visited the city's public and private clubs. He also kept in his mind the rogues who could have other talents. There were several who sported the look of a budding pickpocket or purse snatcher.

Another subset in his collection of acolytes obviously kept their eyes and ears open all of the time. These he cultivated with an extra coin or two. It was from them he learned of other haunts frequented by the 'privileged' class - places boys of their age should have been sheltered from.

While each day Cottle was incentivising his waifs at the sausage vendors, Habib was compiling lists of industries within the city. Gill was doing the same in Hamburg. The Berlin pair decided Cottle should take his show on the road. Cottle introduced Habib to his  favored irregulars as his 'partner' and instructed them to deal with Habib while he would be absent from the city for a few days.

.

Cottle took the overnight train to Hamburg and met with Gill. Gill had been combing his city and expanding his own lists. Cottle told of his success with the street boys and the intention of doing the same in Hamburg. Gill allowed that Hamburg was more cosmopolitan than Berlin and its dens of diversion were less visible and accessible to dirty urchins. His suggestion was to cultivate the bellboys and maids at the vacation hotels to discover who might be dining, recreating, and having intimate conversations with whom. Following this course yielded a flood of sordid gossip, too much to sift through for actual leads. Notwithstanding, Cottle did manage an invitation to a card game with five industrialists. He barely came away with his shirt, and little else.

Cottle and Gill discussed their options. Moguls and magnates might be loose on the ground in Hamburg, but they were either vacationers in the city for diversion or circumspect residents.
Gill, ""We should try another city or another field of inquiry in this city. The Port of Hamburg is a customs and duty-free zone. It has the largest warehouse district in the world. It has been an important financial center for centuries, and is the seat of the world's second oldest bank, Berenberg Bank.""

Cottle, ""I believe you have identified the problem. We have been the wrong people in the right city. Are you up for gainful employment?""

.

They sent a telegram to Habib that afternoon, ""Come if you're free - or reasonable.""

Habib arrived the following day. Gill elaborated on the city's main features and Cottle's plan.

""I will seek a job at the port, Gill at the warehouses, and you at the bank. The first two are always hiring casual labor. The third might be questionable.""

As it happened, the bank was favorably impressed and agreed to take on the very intelligent looking young man who's father had been an executive with the Anglo-Egyptian Bank.

.

Habib's position was nothing to give him access to the type of records the colony would find of value, but it did provide him with an introduction to others in the bank's employ. Particularly, he identified the gentleman in charge of commercial loans, Mr. Kappel, and three young women who had lower-level positions like himself. He noticed the loan officer was often distracted when one of the 'girls' happened to pass his desk.

At the noon break he found the young ladies together eating their bagged lunches. He introduced himself as new to the city and, in the course of conversation, asked if they could recommend a place to have a meal and a beer after work.

They were polite, obliging, and did name a nearby rathskeller. He, in turn, invited them to join him that evening as his guests, so he might not dine alone.

Habib made it a point to be seen by Kappel when the quartet left together.

.

Things at the bank continued as planned. Habib courted the friendship of the young women. He also went out of his way to be noticed by Kappel. The reticent and older Kappel, believing he too might be noticed by the young women were he on friendly terms with Habib, was more gracious to the new employee than might be anticipated.

Picking a topic he already had some familiarity with, Habib contrived to invite Kappel to share dinner with him under the guise of wishing guidance in his work. Kappel, who would have shunned the company away from the bank under usual circumstances, appreciated the younger man was looking for a mentor. He agreed.

The meal went well. Habib, given he was not as ignorant of the subject as he pretended, proved a quick learner. In addition, he managed to impress the gullible Kappel with a few tales about his banker father. 

On the distaff side, Habib managed to have the ladies introduced to his friend, Cottle. This took away much of the burden of having to be constantly entertaining, something Cottle could do without effort. Gill was brought into the mix a few days later. None of the ladies was singled out for attention, but clearly they were now drawn by more than just a free meal.

.

A few weeks passed when tragedy struck. Habib had secured tickets for a much touted musical review and the six were to attend. At the last minute, Gill had to bow out due to a work-related emergency. Habib approached Kappel with his quandary - six expensive tickets and only two gentlemen able to escort three ladies. Would it be a terrible imposition for Kappel to aid in this time of dire need?

Kappel proved not to be an impediment upon the evening, and the ladies took the substitution in stride. Success!

.

While the preparations for this confluence were being arranged, Habib, Cottle, and Gill had also been acquiring masses of information - information which meant nothing to them. The trio required guidance.

Much of this information had been passed along to the colony, but only some of it had been stitched together. It was time to deploy a more competent resource.

Habib was pleased to inform his 'friend' Kappel, that a close family associate would be vacationing in Hamburg for a week and Habib would be gratified if the two could meet. Kappel, who now was basking in a world previously unknown to him, would be delighted. He insisted on playing host. Reservations were made at the most expensive restaurant of his ken. He even purchased a new suit. Who would have thought the acquaintance of a clerk would lead to dining with a personage who could afford to holiday in his city - for an entire week?

Ignatius Boggs appeared on the scene looking as though he had come from a regal wine tasting. He exuded privilege. He was introduced under the fictitious name of Wheller and, in conversation, confided to Kappel that when he chose to work, he 'dabbled'. The pair got on famously, so famously they agreed to dine, sans Habib, later in the week.

Our ladies were similarly awe struck by Wheller. He charmed them by being interested in their duties at the bank and even had some questions. As a matter of fact he had questions for all of us. When he and the three of us were alone he scribbled reams of them. There were lists of queries for each of us and data he wanted Habib to obtain from the 'girls' - he called them that, too. They didn't seem to mind.

The week with Boggs was grueling. He created dozens of something called spreadsheets filled with hieroglyphics. At the end he rolled them into a pair of binocular cavities and was off.

Two weeks after the Boggs' siege on Hamburg, the ladies were informed Gill and Cottle were signing onto to a freighter. They could be gone for more than a month. Two weeks following, Habib's great uncle died and he requested leave to console his grieving relatives.

The trio repaired to Berlin.

"Anyone else want to obtain the skills of analytical reasoning /deduction? I am a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes, I think Arthur Conan Doyle's works are some of the best pieces of literature that I have ever read. I am obsessed with the methods Holmes uses, and knowing Dr. Joseph Bell and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle himself possessed these skills gives me hope that I can develop my habits and train my mind to achieve these skills of analytical observation.
I have the handbook by Ransom Riggs which details some of the methods Holmes used, and some of the so-called methods it mentions are just outright laughably silly, such as when trying to lure a baddie out of his hidey-hole within a house, you are to ""walk away"" and proclaim loudly ""gee, it sure is a shame we could not find his hiding place. We'd better be off now. Good bye."" while others are actually useful, such as determining someone's height by foot size/stride, how to crack a combination lock code, some of the explanations of deduction, and using occam's razor, etc etc. Pretty good book, but not everything is actually practical. However, for the kid that I still am inside, it is a fun read. 
  I have tried a little bit to implement some of the thinking processes by which our detective utilizes and have tried noticing things, observing things. Like how many people were sitting in the seats next to us at the local pub, or the color of our waitress' eyes, hair, clothing, etc were also her name, etc. Trying to notice the world around me more. 
  Anyway, sorry for the ranting. Anyone else wish to obtain the skills of deduction?"

"How would it change things in Watson was Afghani? I just had a thought, and wanted to run it past you--

In the original stories, Watson was an injured English veteran of the Second Afghan War, who was (at least initially) trying to get his life in order after returning home. How do you think it would change things if he wasn't an Afghan vet, but an Afghan himself? Perhaps he was a native combat medic / translator who came back with the troops? 

I could see some interesting scenarios for fanfiction here: perhaps Holmes refuses to enter a hookah lounge or other ""unrefined"" location, so Watson does it instead. Or perhaps he speaks to a fellow Afghan imformant while Holmes is distracted somewhere. 

The way I'm envisioning it, this could be an interesting way to bring some more diversity and equity to their relationship--i.e., Holmes *can't* come up with all these answers, but Watson can finally contribute. 

Unfortunately, though I'd be interested in turning this into a full story, I'm not sure I can; I don't know enough about Anglo-Afghan relations, Afghani culture, etc. etc. etc. But I could definitely keep it on the back burner!"

"Audiobook Help Hi all,

I‚Äôve never been on this sub before so I‚Äôm really sorry if I‚Äôm breaking etiquete here. I am looking for a version of the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes audiobooks and am having trouble finding it. I have pretty severe panic attacks and I find that listening to this specific version of the audiobook helps to calm me down.

He is of course British. Any help finding this would be greatly appreciated and would help me more than I can say. Thank you in advance!!"
Millie Bobby Brown Shares First Look At Sherlock Holmes Spinoff Enola Holmes
I've recently started working my way through the Sherlock Holmes adventures and really enjoying them. Here's my little interpretation of the man.
Isn't Henry Cavill too old to play Millie Bobby Brown's brother in Enola Holmes? Because Henry Cavill is 37 years old and Millie Bobby Brown is 16
"My Thoughts on Enola Holmes I quite enjoyed this film. It was charming with a great cast, Henry Cavill was a pretty good incarnation of the great detective himself, Millie Bobby Brown was quite good in the title role. The film does have its issues like the 4th wall breaking by Enola felt intrusive at times, I get the director was trying to find a witty way around the fact the books are in first person but I don't think it was needed, other than that and some issues, I quite liked the film and would like to see the other 5 books in the Enola Holmes series adapted."

"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 1 The first standard gauge British railway to build coaches with bogies, sprung wheels, instead of rigidly mounted axles, was the Midland Railway in 1874.

Aylesford is a large village on the River Medway, accessed via a medieval five-arched bridge. There has been a settlement on this spot since Neolithic times. Aylesford Priory was founded in 1242. 

As a youth I was taught Latin by an instructor who was brought up in a priory. One day he told a story about a young priest who asked his superior if it would be acceptable if he smoked while he prayed. The superior dismissed the monk, saying it would not, that the supplicant should dedicate his attention entirely to God when praying. Some time passed, and the priest again approached his superior asking if it would be accept able if he prayed while he smoked. The superior praised his devotion.

Maidstone has seen settlement by the Romans and the Normans and was the site of pivotal moments in English history such as the Peasants' Revolt and the Second Civil War.

Mad√ºog√ºiso, in the early British tongue, came to be called Madis, the river being called Madus. The Saxons afterwards called it Medwegston (Medway's town), by contraction in the Domesday Book, Meddestane, and now, Maidstone.

Lenham is a market village and civil parish in Kent situated on the southern edge of the North Downs. Technically the fact that Lenham is allowed a market makes it a town but the community have always desired to maintain its village status.

Mary Honywood was born in Lenham in 1527 and died there in 1620. The woman had eighteen children and lived to see 367 of her descendants.

Ashford began as a Saxon village. By the early 13th century it had grown into a small market town. In 1800 it had a population of a little over two thousand. The railway reached Ashford in 1842 and by 1900 the population reached nearly thirteen thousand.

The Territorial Army had established a volunteer reserve unit in Ashford in 1910. Men were enlisted into the Force by a county association and as part of a specific corps. Periods of initial service were not to exceed four years, but could be extended for a further four years at the end of the first duty. A member of the Force could buy his discharge before the end of his term by giving three months notice and paying a sum of up to five pounds, except in times of embodiment for service.

If the Force was called out for permanent service when the time for a man's discharge came due, he could be required to prolong his service by up to twelve months.

.

I was traveling southeast from London to Hythe on the Great Eastern Railway through some of the country's most historic landmarks.

I have a theory - actually it is only theoretical in that I ascribe what I experience to be attributable to others - not the specifics certainly, but the generalities. My theory is that certain settings are conducive to certain types of thought. For instance, I am most productive analyzing the relationship of numbers when I am sitting upright at a desk. Conversely, if I am drafting the notes of an argument to be presented to reluctant listeners, I am most successful doing so while coincidentally tossing bread to geese in a park. On a train I feel comfortable letting my mind chug along wherever it wishes to go.

The aforementioned is only to explain that while traveling by rail I enjoy the passing scenery. Sometimes I enjoy the other passengers, although when I wish solitude in the compartment I employ a 'face' which scares children and warns off adults. I enjoy the smoothly rocking motion. I enjoy the repetitious clicky-clack. All are conducive to thought - my thought, at any rate - when I'm favorable to allowing the mental process to preclude the mental purpose.

.

I gathered myself knowing the next stop would be the end of the line and my destination. Hythe is a pleasant town with two and three story buildings well tended and clean. It is just large enough that a non resident does not stand out or draw attention.

.

A dozen dignitaries and staff had been in attendance when the Prince of Wales visited Hythe in 1881 for a ceremony at the Royal Military Canal. On this occasion of my arrival there was no heralding, but there was a carriage waiting which took me the several miles to a small farm from whence horseback would be my transport.

The driver became stableman and saddled a roan, provided a step so I might easily get seated, and issued instructions, which I knew in advance, were not to control the reins. He slapped the horse's rump and my mount and I started off at a leisurely pace.

Our trek would have seemed most erratic to any observer. But of course there would be no such observer. Nor would there be any evidence of my trek. The horse's hooves were 'socked' with raw hide and left no trail. Furthermore, as my equine companion and I knew well, our narrow path was the only way through a mile deep swath of gorse and bog. The ground was not as even as first seemed which dictated a measured pace. A quicker gait and any misstep might turn annoyance into alarm. A stumble could prove more than unfortunate.

.

It was an hour before we stopped by a large rock which, through designed happenstance, allowed a convenient disembarkation aid. I unloosed a roll of fabric attached to the saddle, turned my beast around, slapped him as the groom had done, and sent him back the way we'd come.

.

I, in turn, proceeded a short way, over a short rise. Ahead of me presented a complete change of scenery. Bucolic was the only word. All before was a field of clover - and auditory bedlam. The innocent looking vista was aswarm with bees signaling their displeasure at my imminent trespass. At that point I halted, unrolled my burden, and cloaked myself from head to foot in flimsy gauze. Thus protected, and I suspect with the appearance of some fearsome wraith, I invaded their domain.

A quarter mile along brought me past a number of constructed hives and soon enough thereafter into relative quiet. I removed my costume but that brief respite too was broken by a pair of intent bloodhounds come to affirm my credentials.

I passed muster aided by their master's command. ""Mycroft. I'm so pleased you've come.""

.

We walked toward what a number of months ago had been a solitary, modest cottage and, noticing various annexes and outbuildings, I asked their purpose.

""There are more deterrents here than bees and bogs to discourage overland visitors, but people flit in and out from our coastal access with some frequency so we needed extra billets. In addition, I now have separate laboratories and, of course, the coordinating facility has spread like bramble. Wireless telegraphy occupies a building of its own. What you may not recognize are a few crows nests and antennae hidden in the tallest trees and there is even a carrier pigeon coop."" His enthusiasm was palpable and contagious.

.

The facility, when labor, materials, and equipment were required, relied on discrete import by night from the Shorncliffe Military Camp not far up the Strait of Dover coast. The 'colony', as it has been dubbed, is unknown to all but a very few, and its funding is buried in many budgets. The purpose is secret. The location, even more so.

.

Sherlock engaged an ever expanding web of eyes and ears throughout the European continent and they all spoke back to this hub. Every method of conveying information from one place to another, particularly in a covert fashion, was available to, and in use by, his multinational 'irregulars'.

My brother's role was to discover what malignant forces might be currently at work on the continent. My contribution, as it had been throughout my government service, was to ascertain in what way and why those forces might impact His Majesty's Realm. Together we were tasked to adjudge how to defuse and/or deflect those forces.

If an analogy might be drawn, Sherlock functioned as microscope to my telescope, or magnifying glass to my wide lens.

.

It had been a year since I last had met with my brother. But, in that span, we were probably more in contact than at any other period of our adult life. Ironically, the cause was a joined  preoccupation on matters far from home.

Thoughts of home prompted us into a discussion of life at Baker Street. With his departure Holmes had made arrangements that Mrs. Hudson would not require taking in borders to maintain living in her own home. The good woman, on the other hand, knew Sherlock too well to be fooled by his fabrication of retirement. To tend bees, no less - ""Pshaw!"" She would allow that Dr. Watson might be content with the leisure to spoil his grandchildren, but the foremost detective in the world - ""Never!""

.

Under nagging, unrelenting interrogation, Sherlock was forced to confess that he would elsewhere be occupied with 'government' work. Having hovered on the periphery for so many years Mrs. Hudson demanded to be 'dealt in'. Hence, 221A ground floor, replaced 221B first floor, as a periodic stopping place for myself and occasional discrete guests who would lodge above for short durations. At present a raw ore analyst from Barcelona and a senior bank official from Strasbourg enjoyed the hospitality of the Baker Street manse.

"Ranking the Sherlock Holmes Adaptations I hope that this idea has not been posed yet- if so, I would like the link- but, how would you rank the actors that played Sherlock Holmes? Can be from video games, cartoons, tv, movie, books, but can‚Äôt be the stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle because they would obviously be the source material and reference for other media.
Also, if you rank Benedict Cumberbatch in the top five or ten, don‚Äôt bother sending your list (I mean, I won‚Äôt hold it it against you if you do), I just really abhor is portrayal. Holmes was never an atheist, he was quite athletic, and he smoked HEAVILY, not wear some dag-nab-it (or da$&amp;) patches. Also, it would never be implied that he could be anything, but asexual (other than his feelings for Irene, which were ruined in the show).

"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 9 Miss Adler, Sherlock, and I continued the conversation later in the cottage.

""I will suggest there are two issues we ought to address, one immediate, and the second, our near future. At present a reconnaissance of Keil seems in order, but not at the expense of our senior people nor at the frugality of entrusting it to the irregulars. I will put forth that young Gill shows a potential which might best be tested by such a mission. He is unassuming. He needn't be particularly cautious in his travel, and the German rail system could put him there in reasonable time. I'd like you to consider approaching him on the subject and gauging his reaction.

""That brings me to my second point. If Gill is to be absent for the better part of a month the colony shall need a replacement and coincidentally, and more important, should he live up to expectations, we should consider hatching more of him.

""What I have in mind is the establishment of a greenhouse for scouts. Suitable recruits would work along side our staff members who would, in turn, act as tutors, instructing them how to use their acquired skills in the field. I further recommend that the most qualified person to guide this project, if we adopt it, is you, Miss Adler. Head mistress of a spy school, I think, would suit your own gifts admirably.

.

Gill, in his reserved way, was pleased to take on more challenging duties. As it turned out he possessed a smattering of German which we buffered up with some technical basics and terms, and an amateur's talent with a box roll-film camera.

The day his replacement arrived he was sent off.

After much evaluation our first students arrived. Worth mentioning at this point is that, pass or fail, they would not be allowed to know where they had been trained.

We had decided three would be an optimal number. They would rotate individually between Wallace, Blocke, and Rice, spending two weeks with each, and then, back together, two weeks with Miss Adler (and when possible, Sherlock). They were also obliged to lend a hand in the kitchen when called for to offset their added burden on Hauser.

.

On his return young Gill, which we will have to stop calling him since his exploration seems to have matured him significantly, had a story to tell.

""Thanks to author Karl Baedeker's most helpful book, ""Northern Germany as far as the Bavarian and Austrian Frontiers; Handbook for Travellers"", I had no transit difficulties. I also had the good fortune to purchase a map of northern Germany from Wagner and Debes, Leipzig. I carried these with me throughout my trip and made copious notes in the style of a tourist lest they be examined. I've passed along both to Mr. Rice for his library.

""The Germans initially imported their railroad engineering and hardware from Britain but, I'm sorry to say, surpassed us after 1890. They are also ahead of the French, both for passenger and freight transport. Because of subsidization and their tax structure their lines run deep into agricultural areas. The total length of German railroad tracks has tripled since 1871, making it the largest rail network in Europe. The German State Railway Wagon Association (DSV) standardized the system in 1909.

""Under the guise of German road/rail comparison I inquired about their automobile industry. In this arena the tale is reversed. Germany pioneered in the field but I have discovered since my return that the UK might have more manufacturers than Germany has automobiles. In 1910 British vehicle production was 14,000 units. Overall, though, Germany has a thriving economy.

""In Kiel I learned the U boat, SM U-1 was commissioned by the Imperial German Navy in December of 1906. It had a double hull, was powered by a K√∂rting kerosene engine and was armed with a single torpedo tube. The fifty percent larger SM U-2 has two torpedo tubes. They have increased their launching schedule from one a year to two in 1909. I have anticipated improvements and general specifications in my head and will transcribe them for you.""

""Because of its new role as Germany's main naval base, Kiel has increased in size from 18,770 in 1864 to about 200,000 in 1910. The Kiel tramway network which opened in 1881 is under constant expansion.

""The Germaniawerft shipyard is building or has built a number of battleships for the Kaiserliche Marine, including the SMS Posen, launched in December 1908, and commissioned into the High Seas Fleet in May 1910. She was equipped with a main battery of twelve 28 cm guns in six twin turrets. Another battleship, SMS Prinzregent Luitpold has either recently been launched or is about to be launched. I have no more information on it. At least two more ships are planned, but the facility's main concentration is on U boats.""

In addition, Gill brought back several rolls of film and had mailed dozens of picture postcards along his way addressed to Aunt Renie at the Baker Street address.

""For the time being, Gill, you shall be assigned to Miss Adler advising her cadets.

"A beginners ‚Äúbasics‚Äù/guide to Sherlock Holmes? Hey guys!! So I‚Äôve been suuuper interested in Sherlock Holmes for a while- it‚Äôs literally been on my mind all the time, searching everything about it, looking at pictures, etc, so I‚Äôm thinking about getting into it. I thought about watching the show, but I feel like I want to read the books first.             
I‚Äôve done some research and to be honest,  I‚Äôm a little bit confused as to what to read first, how many there are, what is the difference between the short stories and the novel/volumes and many other things. Apparently theres movies too..? Ya, so I decided to come here and seek some help I guess.     
What are the basic things I should know if I‚Äôm only just a beginner? How would you recommend I read the books, and in what order?      
Also, would you recommend watching the show after reading it, or is it somewhat different than the actual plot? I really hope someone can help me! Thanks in advance! "

"The REAL Mycroft Hello folks. I'm currently watching Enola Holmes with my dad and it is becoming increasingly clear that they did Mycroft dirty. Clearly he's nowhere near as clever as in the books and I don't remember him being that mean in the books either.

I'd like to show my dad the REAL Mycroft, as portrayed in the books, but he doesn't like to read, so my plan is to show him one episode of the Jeremy Brett TV adaptation, which I believe shows a fairly accurate depiction of the books.

My question to you folks is, what would be the best Sherlock Holmes story to showcase Mycroft's real character? Thanks!"

Leonard Nimoy as Sherlock Holmes!
"The British Colony a novella by H D Edwards chapter 2 Sherlock's palate had never been refined. Mrs. Hudson kept the London household nourished and well fed, but she had her limitations. Concern for Sherlock and, perhaps, more for myself - even acknowleging my visits would be sporadic - I did raise a voice in the initial colony planning. I argued for a chef from London rather than a mess cook from Shorncliffe. A compromise was reached on a Swiss parolee from the Pentonville Prison. He turned out to be a good fit. He knew cuisine, could handle large numbers when required, and was not hesitant when there were needs elsewhere. Currently there were only six individuals in the colony, not counting ourselves,  so I looked forward to our menu.

Sherlock and I dined privately that evening. His cottage was basically one large room with a loft area toward the rear which provided sleeping quarters to the left and right, accessed and separated by a center stair-ladder arrangement. The former occupants had been a farmer and wife with two children. They left their furnishings which were quite comfortable, albeit modest. Somewhat spoiling the effect, however, were utilitarian bookshelves against every available wall space. These were obviously quartermaster issue.

We enjoyed a nicely prepared dinner. Hauser, the cook, insisted on a vegetable garden and tended it himself. After the server retired we relaxed, I with my cigar and Sherlock with his pipe. Our conversation, as was usual, was filled with non-sequiturs, or what would seem so to an outsider - a little past, present, and obscure.

There was a small fire in the hearth and a nice brandy in hand. A body could doze off without giving it a thought. The ambient mellowness, though, was of a sudden disturbed by a sharp rap on the door. Upon admittance the young cadet, Gill - but they all looked young these days - rushed to Sherlock with a message.

After a moment, Sherlock looked up from what was written and barked at the lad, ""Have everyone gather in the mess immediately and tell Wallace to initiate full alert procedures.""

It seemed only seconds before Sherlock had doused all but minimum light and handed to me a Webley revolver, putting another in his own pocket. ""It appears, Mycroft, we may be under siege very shortly.""

As we exited the cottage I noticed whatever moon there had been prior to our supper was now obscured by ominous black clouds. I could not predict if that would be in our favor or not.

Tension pervaded the mess when we got there. It was not reduced by the dim glow from a single lamp set on the floor in a corner of the room. Following Sherlock's lead we all sat upon the floor. We must have presented an eerie picture. The lamplight reflected off Rice's glasses and illumined Wallace's hair and beard. Everyone was armed as we were.

Sherlock addressed us, ""It is being reported that several small boats have been taken at gunpoint by a dozen men on the opposite French shore. Troops from Shorncliffe have been assigned to craft and are patrolling the Strait as I speak. It is unknown the target or purpose of these men. It is, however, up to us to protect the colony from detection at all costs.""

At this point the reader should be aware of our immediate topography to understand what this protection might entail. Along our bit of coast, unlike the forbidding Dover cliffs or the inviting beach at Folkestone, we have shingle, rock, and quite quickly a rise of forest. The colony is less than half a mile from water's edge. By design it has been 'helped' to look unappealing and, at the same time, unexciting.

Wallace and Blocke were directed to scout to the south. Rice and Hauser would go north while Sherlock and I would cover the center. The north and south pairs each would take a hound. Pencer, the radio operator, and Gill, the dogsbody lad, would stay behind to monitor for new developments and report to each party if needs be. 

Sherlock spoke gravely, ""Given the critical nature of our work and the high likelihood that we might be numerically and tactically disadvantaged if we are the intended objective, everyone is instructed to shoot anything coming from the sea - anything - without compunction or hesitation.""

A password and response were issued so we would not fire upon each other, and we then proceeded into a beginning drizzle which promised to get worse. It was well past midnight.

.

As we made our cautious way to the shore we could hear a smattering of shots coming from out in the Strait. We could make out no muzzle flashes, but visibility was extremely limited. Turning north at water's edge we began looking for any evidence of human encroachment. Darkness, combined with the now steady rain, made for slow going. We still heard intermittent gunfire. About 250 yards along Sherlock stopped suddenly with a hand on my sleeve. He'd sensed something which I had not. Pausing for a full minute he ventured the password. A correct answer came back.

Mr. Rice emerged from the dark and reported nothing untoward. It was agreed we would sweep our respective patches at least until dawn.

Sherlock and I meticulously retraced our steps. A mere 20 yards past our initial entry place we spied an ominous shadow just at the water's edge. Cautiously we advanced until we could discern that it was a small rowing boat - empty, but with a gash in its bottom.

""What do you make of that?"", I quietly asked.

I received no answer as Sherlock dropped to his knees in the shale. He plied his signature absorption and determination for a good ten minutes. He spent another ten where the trees began. But his face betrayed frustration, his eyes said it all. Nothing was there to be found. If ever there had been it was all washed away with the downpour and an incoming tide.

We stood for a bit in silence and conjecture, the still beating rain washing the blood and grit from my brother's injured hands. At last he whispered, ""Mycroft, you go back to the colony and see what news has come to us. It's been a while since we've heard any shooting. I'll continue south and see if there is anything else to discover. We'll meet back here in half an hour.""

We went our ways, and I applied a sharp eye for anything that might have survived the elements on my way to the radio building. When I got close I saw the lights were full on. That was a surprise.

Pencer was more than pleased to inform me the soldiers had accounted for all the stolen craft and counted out all of the attackers. Five were shot and killed, seven were drowned. What they couldn't provide, though, was a reason. A bunch of pernicious foreigners, the worse for drink and gone on rampage?

I hastened back to rendezvous with Sherlock and kept going past the damaged boat. It was just coming on to dawn and I could see him about 30 yards further along. We met half way and I repeated the military's report. We discussed the damaged boat, that the oars were missing, and that it could have broken loose from anywhere and have simply been cast up by the tide. Certainly rowing across the Strait seemed a desperate thing for anyone to consider. We returned to it and Sherlock insisted on a further look around.

Within two minutes he beckoned me into the nearby wood. He signaled for quiet and removed the pistol from his pocket. All in the same instant a voice came to us, ""Good morning Mr. Sherlock Holmes"", Holmes raised his gun, and then a knee seemed to give way. He nearly fell. He regained himself, and in that moment the scruffiest looking drowned rat of an individual tumbled from the nearest tree.

""Miss Adler, so nice of you to drop in."" said Sherlock. His voice sounded somewhat shaky, but I was quite shaken myself.

The rat became upright and Sherlock said, ""Miss Adler, please allow me to introduce to you my brother, Mycroft. Mycroft, this is Miss Irene Adler.""

""The pleasure is most assuredly mine."" chimed our apparition. 

Sherlock put the Webley back into his pocket - and the rain stopped.

Sketchbook Diary of WII Soldier
"Intelligent Sherlock Holmes To mirror my last post, has there been a Sherlock Holmes adaptation that makes the audience feel stupid? 
In the books, the reader had the same intellect (maybe less) as Watson. So, when Holmes explained how he came to his conclusion, Watson (and maybe the reader) thought the solution was more obvious than what was configured without his help. 
Because of that fact, I am wondering if an adaptation stayed faithful to that regard and made the audience feel stupid after Holmes explains.

I might be slightly answering my own question, but RDJ played an action Holmes instead of detective; I don‚Äôt know what Basil Rathbone was doing, but he didn‚Äôt seem to be portraying Holmes, other than having the same name; I don‚Äôt know about Jeremy Brett; Benedict Cumberbatch seems the most robotic, so maybe him (although his adaptation does not think before speaking); and I am not sure of any other portrayal."
Obvious Sherlock Holmes
"Sherlock Holmes books? I want to try reading the books but I‚Äôm worried about a few things. The main thing I‚Äôm worried about is that some publishers maybe publish different versions of the stories that maybe they‚Äôve changed a little because they think it‚Äôll be better or something, I don‚Äôt know. Another thing I‚Äôm worried about is the illustrations not being there. The worried come from a complete set of the books I found on Amazon where one of the reviews said it was riddled with errors and didn‚Äôt have any of the original illustrations of stuff like floor plans or something. They said the reader misses out on a lot of key information and even whole stories without these illustrations. Is this true? Where might I be able to find copies of the books that stick to the original printings‚Äô content? Thank you for any help."

"My thoughts on The Red-Headed League *In which Holmes and Watson meet a fiery pawnbroker whose luck has run out.*

The Red-Headed League was [considered by Sir Arthur Conan-Doyle as the second-best of his Holmes stories](https://lithub.com/the-12-best-sherlock-holmes-stories-according-to-arthur-conan-doyle/) when reflecting on his output in 1927. It‚Äôs hard to disagree with the author, as this adventure, in particular, has remained in my memory since first reading it many years ago. 

That retention ‚Äì not unusual for me as I tend to store details well ‚Äì stands it ahead of all but one story in my mind too. Upon reading its title again, I at once knew the solution to the mystery and most of the details of the story.

Once of Conan-Doyle‚Äôs more ingenious plots, *The Red-Headed League* sees a poor pawnbroker approach Sherlock Holmes with an intriguing case. For two months he‚Äôs been paid by the titular league to sit in an office for four hours a day alone, copying out the encyclopaedia. Apparently selected for the job due to his fiery red hair, he found it an odd occupation but needed the money so went along with it.

One day, he turned up for work and found the office closed with a sign saying the League has been disbanded. Making some enquiries, the pawn broken learns that the office was rented under a false name and there is no record of the Red-Headed League ever existing.

Holmes believes he will have the case solved in a few days but warns the pawnbroker not to expect any further payment. Conferring with Watson, Sherlock reveals he suspects the truth runs much deeper than a peculiar prank played on an unsuspecting shopkeeper. 

To return briefly to Conan-Doyle‚Äôs list, it became the last known opinion of his creation from the author, who died around three years later. There‚Äôs little detail in his list, but he does note that this story, alongside *The Dancing Men*, wins a place for its ‚Äúoriginality of plot‚Äù. I‚Äôll speak for the latter in due course, but as for *The Red-Headed League,* I can‚Äôt think of a mystery with its unusual combination of the humdrum and fantastical. 

While the mystery is first-rate, its revelation requires some stage management by Conan-Doyle. Not unusual in his stories, but handled clumsily here, Holmes solves the case then proceeds to send Watson home while he makes arrangements. There is, of course, no reason for Sherlock to hold onto his knowledge other than to string the audience along. On this occasion though, it seems out of character for the theatrical detective to hold back information only to reveal it that evening. Usually, there is at least the mention of Holmes having to check a few facts before he is sure of himself.

Overall though, the story is more than enough to make up for this slight detour into contrivance. It‚Äôs original and unusual enough to linger long in the memory. Interestingly, in the 1985 Granada TV adaptation, the criminal in this case was revealed to be a student of Professor Moriarty. Had Conan-Doyle planned Holmes‚Äô nemesis earlier, this would have made a wonderful addition to his web of villains working throughout the London underworld."

Also, how do people know who Holmes is but say he works alone? That would mean Watson doesn't exist yet, which also makes no sense since his accounts are what gives his friend fame to begin with."

My great great great great (not sure how many greats) uncle was a man named Charles Mycroft. According to family stories passed down, he was a friend of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, which as a family we like to think means that there's a pretty good chance that he was the namesake of Mycroft Holmes.

I don't have any real evidence to back it up as a story, so I'm wondering if anyone here knows anything about the origins of Mycroft's name or might be able to tell me where to look.

I fully accept that there's a good chance the story is false but until I'm shown otherwise I'm choosing to believe it because it's pretty cool."

"Have I found myself caught up in some sort of Holmesian mystery? I'm reposting this from another subreddit because it took 5 hours to be approved, so it didn't really get any attention, and I would love to tease your brains and hear your thoughts on this silly situation of mine:

 

Earlier  this year, right as the pandemic was starting to heat up, I found  myself on the opposite coast of the US from my home state and needed to  purchase a car to get myself back across the country. I found an  affordable, used, newer-model vehicle at a dealership.

Today,  I received a strange hand-written letter from the dealership, along  with a business card. They explained that they had a customer who was  looking for the exact make, model, year, and color as my car, and they  were willing to offer me up to $2000 above the trade-in value to buy the  car back from me, if I still had it. There is nothing outwardly  interesting about this vehicle, that would explain why someone was so  intent about finding this exact model. In fact, with a carfax search I  found dozens of the exact same vehicle within a few hundred miles of  where I purchased it, at close to the same price I purchased it at.

I  puzzled over the letter for a minute. I could use the money more than I  could use the car right now, so it's an appealing offer. But my mind  quickly went to the wonderful Sherlock Holmes short story ""The Blue  Carbuncle,"" in which a Christmas goose with a stolen gemstone in its  stomach is accidentally sold to an unknowing customer, leading to the  thief's desperate efforts to track down the hapless buyer.

Is  there a bunch of drugs or cash or diamonds stashed in my car somewhere?  The person who sent this letter evidently knows the vehicle is  thousands of miles away from them, as they reached me at my home  address. What could explain their desire to reclaim this specific car,  from thousands of miles away, at the extra cost of transportation and a  much higher trade-in value?

Some other details that may or may not be relevant:

\-The  previous owner of the vehicle was a rental car company(in a state with a  reputation for higher-than-average criminal activity.)

\-The  letter has no return address written on it, although it does contain a  business card for and is signed by someone I personally dealt with at  the dealership

\-The dealership was  in full-on Covid-mode(skeleton crew,) when I made the purchase, so I  dealt with someone who was not actually a salesman but was instead the  financing guy, who was clearly not super familiar with the inventory.

\-Although  both cars were listed online, the car that I was originally interested  in was nowhere to be found on the lot, and no one knew where it was, so I  went for the one that that was the same year, make, almost the same  model, but a different color

\-There  seems to be a discrepancy between the actual color of the vehicle and  what is listed on the title. (neither matches the color of the other  vehicle I was looking to buy, at all) Have they made some huge  dealership fuckup that they are trying to quietly rectify?

\-Last  night between 1am and 6:30am three unlocked cars in my apartment  driveway were accessed and rifled though, which has never happened  before, not in the driveway, although this isn't a particularly good  neighborhood. My car was locked, or at least, had been locked by this  morning, and showed no sign of break-in.

Anyway,  I thought this was kind of a fun turn of events for me, and others might have insight or enjoy puzzling over it. I'm open to ideas on how  to safely take advantage of the situation for personal gain, since I'm  not particularly interested in fighting crime just for the sake of it,  as long as no one is getting hurt."

I am confused on a point in this story; I've only seen the episode of the show with David Suchet. (Season 2, Episode 1)

At the beginning of the story, Poirot is first alerted to the plot to kill Nick by finding a bullet hole in Nick's hat, and then finds a bullet on the ground, confirming his suspicions.

Who fired the bullet? We are lead to believe that it was fired from Nick's father's Mauser, which was stolen, but the person ultimately revealed to be in possession of the gun can't possibly have fired it at Nick's head. So where did the bullet come from? Is it explained in the book?"

This cat looks like Poirot!
"Hickory Dickory Dock In the last scene of the ITV adaptation (Suchet et al) of *Hickory Dickory Dock*, Japp, who has been staying with Poirot while Mrs. Japp is out of town, cooks lunch for Poirot.  The authentically English menu:  mushy peas, mashed potatoes, and faggots, with spotted dick for desert.  The scene is played for laughs, as Poirot begs off of eating the meal because of food allergies - ""*le phobia des faggots*"" - and Japp hopes he doesn't also have ""*le phobia de dick*"" that would keep him from enjoying the desert.  Is this the scriptwriters poking some fun at the fairly common audience belief that Poirot is gay?  Is this their giving Poirot a little comeuppance after Japp has been made to look like a rube the whole time he stayed with Poirot?  (For example, his supposed complete unfamiliarity with the concept of a bidet?)"

"Absolution? Poirots refusal to take communion and receive God‚Äôs forgiveness has me wondering why. 
1. He did not kill his parishioners and was shielding them in good faith. Maybe the ptsd he suffers from disallows him from accepting that truth. 
2.He saved the young soldier from being a murderer, even though the commander killed him, the soldier did not commit an eternal sin.
3. Even the commander could not kill a priest, and knocked him out Which has a little bearing on my question of why not take communion.
4.  My husband thinks maybe poirot is sparing others from his anguish by refusing to tell the story but I would think he would be required to except God‚Äôs love and forgiveness as a man of the cloth.

Redditors who understand religion and communion, and poirot , what do you think? Does he have an obligation to take communion and receive forgiveness?"

I know how the book ends, but i'm confused on the this movies adaptation. I have been trying to look up explanations but no luck. I have read that Poirot does end up telling the police a different story, letting the passengers go free.

What i saw was poirot leaving, pulling out his rosary. I interpreted it as it was up to us to conclude what Poirot presented to the police and whether or not the passengers were arrested.

How did everyone conclude they were free?

Hello all, wanted to contribute an interesting quirk I've noticed that doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.

Long story short, it seems that Herg√© drew a cameo/referenced Agatha Christie's [Hercule Poirot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot) within one of his less famous books. It's not Tintin per se, but within the side series of [Jo, Zette and Jocko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Jo,_Zette_and_Jocko#The_Valley_of_the_Cobras). I couldn't find subs for that series though, so I'm posting it here under the general 'Herge' umbrella.

In the book [Valley of the Cobras](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ABz-D4fCx367j-A&amp;cid=829A85CF8BE28660&amp;id=829A85CF8BE28660%21385&amp;parId=829A85CF8BE28660%21334&amp;o=OneUp), the Maharajah of Gopal has need of a detective to track down a misplaced pearl necklace. And on [page 4](http://imgur.com/D7ThrBf), a familiar portly man with with an [egg-shaped head and a magnificent mustache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot#Appearance_and_proclivities) going by the name of ['Hercule Goodspy'](http://imgur.com/JNviY5m), appears. 

Aside from the similarities in the first name, appearances and vocation, there's good reason to believe that this character isn't simply a random detective. The same page shows the Maharajah referring to an obvious caricature of [Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes) complete with his trademark pipe and deerstalker hat. A later page has an example of how Sherlock was portrayed as a [detective pursuing physical clues,](http://imgur.com/5Z4sqTN) which itself was [markedly different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot#Methods) from [Poirot's psychological approach.](http://www.manybooks4u.net/book2/Murder_on_the_Links/index_5.html)

Furthermore, Valley of the Cobras was published in 1956, which would have been several years after Agatha's Poirot [became hugely popular.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot_in_literature) That Poirot was a Belgian detective and Herg√© himself was a Belgian [writing a Franco-Belgian comic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Jo,_Zette_and_Jocko#The_Valley_of_the_Cobras) might not have factored into his decision to include a cameo of Poirot into one of his books, but it seems overwhelmingly likely that this physically similar character is indeed a reference to Poirot (in the same way there's a later reference to Sherlock).

My take? Herg√© might have found it amusing to include an iconic character that older readers (who might've read Agatha) would know of. Children may have recognized the Sherlock reference, but it seems too coincidental that this character was included in a book when just when Poirot was becoming more popular (or already was). And so Poirot got a brief cameo in another literary world :)

"Finished 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles', thoughts. So, think I'm going to slow down a bit, having now read:

&gt;Murder on the Orient Express

&gt;Death on the Nile

&gt;The Murder of Roger Ackroyd

&gt;The A.B.C. Murders

&gt;The Mysterious Affair at Styles


...this past week. Not that I'm enjoying them any less, but rather the opposite, I've basically put a bunch of other stuff on hold this last week flying through these.

As to 'The Mysterious Affair at Styles', she got me again. I played right into her hands. From early on I suspected John, and then he got arrested and I felt like a genius, and then realized I still had about 25% of the story to go, and felt a fool. I was sure it wasn't Lawrence relatively early, even when the fingerprints came up, I was convinced Christie was doing that thing she loves to do where she draws your attention to two people but then only digs into one hoping you'll ignore or forget about the other. And the coffee cup thing I didn't know exactly what the reason was, but I did suspect rightly that their drawing attention to his terror-struck face, his medical background, and the hints that he and Cynthia got along surprisingly well when alone (and that Hastings naively dropped the line about seeing how he could be love-able when one got to know him), and put together that A. his secret was going to be that he loved Cynthia, and B. he suspected someone else of doing something (The terror-struck face not directed at his mother but something else in the room felt way too on the nose for Christie, basically ruled him out because he was to suspicious right away... ironically). 

All this being too suspicious however, also led me to play right into Christie's hands with Alfred. I thought his wife calling his name was a clear red herring. So by the time Poirot read the letter I was fooled completely. 

I also thought about Cynthia and the bromides, but I never suspected she'd poison them. Would be too obvious, both in-universe and as a reader. Briefly considered that she could have pretended to be Alfred to source the poison in a way that couldn't be traced back to her. But again, she has ample access to her own poisons, and nobody would suspect her prints or anything when she clearly works with said poison regularly. It occurred to me there was still the incentive to frame Alfred, but to that point, I started thinking, this is a very sloppy way to frame someone, she would have no way of ensuring he had an alibi. 

Which brings me to the framing of Albert, which honestly, looking back on it, if the story had ended any other way, would have bothered me in the same sloppiness that got him temporarily exonerated. Everything else was too cleverly concealed. 

I did not put together the tampering with the bell being of the same night Emily skipped her medicine, which should have been a very obvious clue as to the poison being her medicine in retrospect, but I was too hung up on characters to consider it. Like, at that point I figured it'd give clue as to the methods of the killer, but I didn't think it'd reveal the killer, so I put the bell to the back of my mind.

I never suspected the Doctor for the same reason Poirot rules him out, couldn't think of a motive. Considered Mary but in a way, there was too much leading that direction, and again, I thought her secret was going to be an affair, but then when she had that talk of running away, her motive seemed less plausible, and it would have been a surprise for someone like Christie to write a character so inconsistent. She was too real with Hastings, and someone whose response to an oppressive atmosphere is flight instead of fight... It could have been her, but that would have annoyed me very much if were. Too much of an act for someone she didn't have to convince of anything.

So I guessed quite a bit right, but ultimately got it wrong, and completely believed Evelyn to be genuine in her hatred of Alfred. But again, thought it was going to come up as another red herring (I actually suspected that it would be revealed her hatred was genuine, but for a different reason, that they weren't cousins, but were actually at one point married or something, explaining the shared last name, and her hatred).

---
Overall thoughts, I wasn't sure what to expect, knowing this was the first in the series. I thought maybe the ending would be a bit more straight forward, and was happily and handily fooled. I also knew Poirot was a Belgian living in England, but it never occurred to me he was a war refuge. Different times and all, but I guess I figured he would be relatively poor in that case, and since in every other case I've read he was retired and seemed not wanting for money, I assumed he had just relocated in retirement, the setting being war-time not holding much significance to his character itself. I am considering taking notes next time instead of trying to keep everything in my head, but the problem there is that Christie adds so little superfluousness, so many red herrings, and hides so many clues in plain sight, that the notes surrounding the case would rival the length of the publications themselves. I may at least jot down facts of the crime itself as keeping track of those details seems to be weaker than my ability to tease apart character relationships and motivations. 

Next up is probably going to either be 'The Murder on the Links' or ""Elephants Can Remember"", the former by order of rating and release, the latter being recommended. I also don't understand how GoodReads ranking system works, as I thought I had a list ordered by ranking but the average ranking on some of them are higher than the ones above them, with similar number of readers having ranked them."

"Best Poirot BBC adaptation, best Poirot mystery? This year I'm attempting a reading challenge in which one category is ""book(s) adapted into a TV series."" I've seen three motion pictures adapted from Poirot mysteries (*Death on the Nile*, *Evil Under the Sun*, *Murder on the Orient Express*) and yes, I know it's a grievous oversight I haven't seen a Suchet Poirot (I don't have a television, still not an excuse), so I'd like to engage in this properly: see a BBC-produced Poirot mystery, and then maybe either read the novel itself, or the best Poirot novel. It's been decades since I read one, so I likely won't notice a reread. 

What are your suggestions for:

Its because of great atmosphere, great acting, characters, soundtrack.

I especially enjoy movies where Poirot is traveling, like Murder at MEsopatamia, or Appointment with death, they have some kind of strange magic."

"Why does Poirot always... Don't get me wrong, I adore the Belgian detective ... but why does he always convince people to kill themselves? Like, in *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* he catches the bad guy but he's all like, ""you can go to jail, or if you want you can just poison yourself"" and he does. And in *Peril at End House*, he lets the culprit overdose on cocaine--hell, he's the one who gives her the cocaine for that specific purpose!! I get that prison isn't ideal, but Poirot straight up encourages them to do it, and when they do he treats it like a mercy. I get that he's just following his idea of justice, but it's kind of a bummer when you think about it. Especially compared to other detectives. Like, there are plenty of classic detectives who are relentless in pursuit of justice (e.g. Holmes, Spade, L); the difference is that THEIR idea of justice is always a prison sentence. So it's a pretty weird thing for him to do. He's done it twice now in what I've read."

I particularly enjoyed the stories where the murders were somewhat justifiable, ofc the Orient Express is a good example, but also ""Appointment With Death"". I truly appreciate the nuance they try to show in the tv series, Poirot struggling to come to terms with the Murder on the Orient Express was very impactful. However, my favorite has to be the final episode. Poirot making the decision to do what he did might be my favorite final character moment in any form of media. What were your favorite Poirot moments?"

"Anyone else watching Poirot in these difficult times just to escape? I mean to literally escape. The time period. Our homes were stuck in. Our countries. This issue that plagues all of us right now. Poirot gives me a chance to watch others travel and drink wine together. Eat together. Work with one another. Joke around. Seeing other people interact with each other is comforting, more so than usual. Poirot always scratches this itch but it is amplified during these tough times. I always watch it frequently but the last month or so it‚Äôs literally all I‚Äôve watched."

2.He saved the young soldier from being a murderer, even though the commander killed him, the soldier did not commit an eternal sin.
3. Even the commander could not kill a priest, and knocked him out Which has a little bearing on my question of why not take communion.
4.  My husband thinks maybe poirot is sparing others from his anguish by refusing to tell the story but I would think he would be required to except God‚Äôs love and forgiveness as a man of the cloth.

Poirot simply states the killer had a duplicate costume but does not explain why he would have one. Nothing about the murder suggest premeditation. He killed the guy with a butter knife from the table. Did I miss something? Can someone explain the second costume for me?
Plz tell me Where do people watch poirot? I am from norway and i can find it anywhere. Let me know

"Agatha's Poirot by Herg√© (Was crossposted and originally written for [r/theadventuresoftintin](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAdventuresofTintin/comments/663816/xpost_rpoirot_agathas_poirot_by_herg%C3%A9/) but the overall gist is the same)

Hello all, wanted to contribute an interesting quirk I've noticed that doesn't seem to be mentioned anywhere.

Long story short, it seems that Herg√© drew a cameo/referenced Agatha Christie's [Hercule Poirot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot) within one of his less famous books. It's not Tintin per se, but within the side series of [Jo, Zette and Jocko](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Jo,_Zette_and_Jocko#The_Valley_of_the_Cobras). I couldn't find subs for that series though, so I'm posting it here under the general 'Herge' umbrella.

In the book [Valley of the Cobras](https://onedrive.live.com/?authkey=%21ABz-D4fCx367j-A&amp;cid=829A85CF8BE28660&amp;id=829A85CF8BE28660%21385&amp;parId=829A85CF8BE28660%21334&amp;o=OneUp), the Maharajah of Gopal has need of a detective to track down a misplaced pearl necklace. And on [page 4](http://imgur.com/D7ThrBf), a familiar portly man with with an [egg-shaped head and a magnificent mustache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot#Appearance_and_proclivities) going by the name of ['Hercule Goodspy'](http://imgur.com/JNviY5m), appears. 

Aside from the similarities in the first name, appearances and vocation, there's good reason to believe that this character isn't simply a random detective. The same page shows the Maharajah referring to an obvious caricature of [Sherlock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes) complete with his trademark pipe and deerstalker hat. A later page has an example of how Sherlock was portrayed as a [detective pursuing physical clues,](http://imgur.com/5Z4sqTN) which itself was [markedly different](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot#Methods) from [Poirot's psychological approach.](http://www.manybooks4u.net/book2/Murder_on_the_Links/index_5.html)

Furthermore, Valley of the Cobras was published in 1956, which would have been several years after Agatha's Poirot [became hugely popular.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hercule_Poirot_in_literature) That Poirot was a Belgian detective and Herg√© himself was a Belgian [writing a Franco-Belgian comic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Jo,_Zette_and_Jocko#The_Valley_of_the_Cobras) might not have factored into his decision to include a cameo of Poirot into one of his books, but it seems overwhelmingly likely that this physically similar character is indeed a reference to Poirot (in the same way there's a later reference to Sherlock).

My take? Herg√© might have found it amusing to include an iconic character that older readers (who might've read Agatha) would know of. Children may have recognized the Sherlock reference, but it seems too coincidental that this character was included in a book when just when Poirot was becoming more popular (or already was). And so Poirot got a brief cameo in another literary world :)

Thoughts?

Poirot can't bear crime
The world is insane so I decided to do a rewatch. As soon as I heard the intro music a wave of calm just washed over me. I love this show.
"What episode should I watch next? I've read some of the Poirot books (not much, maybe 5 or 6) and I've recently found the series and loved it! I need some recommendations though.

So far I've watched and loved: Peril at End House (my favorite) and The Cypress. Hallowe'en Party was okay... And now I'm watching Three Act Tragedy which I love but is also a bit confusing because of the whole war, MI6, navy thing. Anything political confuses me because I'm not British or European so it's less interesting.

I've watched the movies: Murder on the Orient Express, Death on the Nile (my favorite), Appointment with Death, Evil Under the Sun and Thirteen at Dinner. I know they're not Suchet's so I'll rewatch their episodes last.

What other episodes do you recommend that are your favorite and I would like?

Thanks!"

So i just finished the book and just finished watching the 2010 version of Murder on the Orient Express.

I know how the book ends, but i'm confused on the this movies adaptation. I have been trying to look up explanations but no luck. I have read that Poirot does end up telling the police a different story, letting the passengers go free.

What i saw was poirot leaving, pulling out his rosary. I interpreted it as it was up to us to conclude what Poirot presented to the police and whether or not the passengers were arrested.

How did everyone conclude they were free?

Please help, im not good at interpreting haha

Thanks!"

I constantly rewatch episodes because I find the show's british settings, Poirot's mannerisms, and fanciful plots incredibly comforting and soothing. I once found episodes of Poirot on a long international flight and it made me so incredibly happy. It's safe to say I'm officially obsessed with the show. 

I'm slowly panicking that the rest will disappear too. Even iTunes doesn't have series 1-6. For Poirot. I might be willing to buy a DVD-reader and the full DVD set...

Anyone have ideas of alternative ways to watch it? "

"Hickory Dickory Dock In the last scene of the ITV adaptation (Suchet et al) of *Hickory Dickory Dock*, Japp, who has been staying with Poirot while Mrs. Japp is out of town, cooks lunch for Poirot.  The authentically English menu:  mushy peas, mashed potatoes, and faggots, with spotted dick for desert.  The scene is played for laughs, as Poirot begs off of eating the meal because of food allergies - ""*le phobia des faggots*"" - and Japp hopes he doesn't also have ""*le phobia de dick*"" that would keep him from enjoying the desert.  Is this the scriptwriters poking some fun at the fairly common audience belief that Poirot is gay?  Is this their giving Poirot a little comeuppance after Japp has been made to look like a rube the whole time he stayed with Poirot?

"DISCUSSION: Radical Crossover Musing As both a Poirot and superhero fan, rewatching ""Four and Twenty Blackbirds"" (1989) and hearing Poirot remark that no one understands cricket (while actually knowing everything about it) reminded me of [a similar line](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUGP_Pv42g8) by Raphael in the 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie, and made me wonder -- would I be the only one in the world who would enjoy something as seemingly dissonant as a Poirot/Ninja Turtles comic book crossover?

* Poirot and Donatello would lead the investigation.
* Hastings and Michelangelo would provide the questions.
* Chief Inspector and Leonardo would provide the moral support.
* Miss Lemon and Raphael would provide the wit.

Poirot and Splinter sharing wisdom, culture, and experiences, Poirot debating expressions, food, philosophies, and (of course) sanitation with the Turtles, Hastings embracing the local customs, a love of the law shared by all -- what's not to like?!

There's an opening newsreel sequence that mentions George Connor (and shows him!) so you can see what he looks like and the actor in the first couple of minutes. Then 5 minutes in they show Paul Renauld who (surprise, surprise) is played by the same actor, looks exactly the same and just has some gray hairs. He sees Poirot in the hotel and immediately acts worried which gives it away even more.

I remember this plot point being a big deal when I was reading the book and to have it almost spoiled so early felt kind of bad. How did everyone else feel about this when they saw the episode? Or just the episode in general?"

A new episode of The Amateur Detective Club: ABC Murders!
Did anyone see the Poirot episode without a murder? I thought it was an interesting spin.  No spoiler unless you mention the actual episode tho...
What's everyone's favourite exchange between Hercule and the other main characters? I always liked how he gently goaded Miss Lemon
The world is insane so I decided to do a rewatch. As soon as I heard the intro music a wave of calm just washed over me. I love this show.
"Has anyone that has read the books actually enjoy the tv series? I partially watched ""Dumb Witness"" and ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"", and they totally stray away from the source material. It's like watching a completely different thing compared to the books. Do any of the episodes actually match the books or are they all this bad? I really wish the series followed the books because David Suchet is such a great actor for Poirot. What do you guys think? (also, if you enjoyed the show, please only defend it if you've read the books)"

"Exploring the ""Poirot"" restoration: Murder in the Mews Due to an illness I'm a few days late with this one, but the next one'll be out on Sunday, back on schedule!

I'm exploring the film restoration of the Suchet TV series, one episode per week. This is episode number two, ""Murder in the Mews"":

My friends and I had a fun time theorizing about a spin-off with just Japp!
This is what I imagine Poirot looks like
"I'm setting my ""non-contact"" / ""unknown caller"" ringtones to the Poirot Theme. After all, whatever's behind that call is a mystery..."

"Why does Poirot always... Don't get me wrong, I adore the Belgian detective ... but why does he always convince people to kill themselves? Like, in *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* he catches the bad guy but he's all like, ""you can go to jail, or if you want you can just poison yourself"" and he does. And in *Peril at End House*, he lets the culprit overdose on cocaine--hell, he's the one who gives her the cocaine for that specific purpose!! I get that prison isn't ideal, but Poirot straight up encourages them to do it, and when they do he treats it like a mercy. I get that he's just following his idea of justice, but it's kind of a bummer when you think about it. Especially compared to other detectives. Like, there are plenty of classic detectives who are relentless in pursuit of justice (e.g. Holmes, Spade, L); the difference is that THEIR idea of justice is always a prison sentence. So it's a pretty weird thing for him to do. He's done it twice now in what I've read."
A new episode of Amateur Detective Club: Peril at End House!
New season/series added to Netflix US (now up to 11) I was just watching Futurama on lunch at work and when I closed the app on my phone it poped up with a notice that they have added new series to Netflix USA. It is up to and including series 11. I haven't watched the show in a while as even trying to pirate the season that weren't on there was hard.
Always a step ahead
"Trivial question Hey everyone. In the episode ""The Kidnapped Prime Minister"" towards the end, Daniels is caught trying to escape and bought before Poirot, Hastings and the British Secretary. He is asked ""Why Daniels?, have you gone mad?"" to which he replies ""Let me go to Imogen"". He then repeats this phrase. What does it mean?"

"Poirot's lapel pin I can't afford one but this seller makes one closer to the one David wore than any I've seen. Beautiful.

"Was looking to watch this show, but noticed Netflix starts it at Season 7. I've never seen any Poirot but it looks interesting and I wanted to give it a shot.

Is it best to start at Season 1? Or does continuity not matter much? Would it be okay to start at Season 7?

Thanks.

EDIT: Also is there anything else I should know about the show before jumping in? Are there any seasons that are considered especially good or not-so-good by the fan base?"
